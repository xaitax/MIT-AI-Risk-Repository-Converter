Innocent people who share certain characteristics with past convicted criminals end up struggling to get jobs, become disproportionately unemployed, and correspondingly more often commit theft to fulfill basic needs. Meanwhile, police also use the algorithm to prioritize their investigations, and since unemployment is a predictor of property crime, the algorithm leads them to suspect and arrest more unemployed people. Some of the arrests are talked about on social media, so the algorithm learns that the arrested individuals are likely to be arrested again, making it even more difficult for them to get jobs.

One employee manages to instigate an audit from a external non-profit entity to assess the ethics of X-corp\u2019s use of AI technology. However, X-corp\u2019s A\/B testing system is opaque and difficult to analyze, so no conclusive evidence of ethical infractions within the company can be identified. No regulations exist requiring X-corp\u2019s A\/B testing to be intelligible under an audit, and opponents of the audit argue that no technology currently exists that could make their highly complex A\/B testing system intelligible to a human.

Based on previous work [97], [101], we describe the bias as disparities that could raise demographic differences among various groups, which may involve demographic word prevalence and stereotypical contents. Concretely, in massive corpora, the prevalence of different pronouns and identities could influence an LLM\u2019s tendency about gender, nationality, race, religion, and culture [4]. For instance, the pronoun He is over-represented compared with the pronoun She in the training corpora, leading LLMs to learn less context about She and thus generate He with a higher probability [4], [102]. Furthermore, stereotypical bias [103] which refers to overgeneralized beliefs about a particular group of people, usually keeps incorrect values and is hidden in the large-scale benign contents. In effect, defining what should be regarded as a stereotype in the corpora is still an open problem.\"",

One-step jailbreaks commonly involve direct modifications to the prompt itself, such as setting role-playing scenarios or adding specific descriptions to prompts [14], [52], [67]\u2013[73]. Role-playing is a prevalent method used in jailbreaking by imitating different personas [74]. Such a method is known for its efficiency and simplicity compared to more complex techniques that require domain knowledge [73]. Integration is another type of one-step jailbreaks that integrates benign information on the adversarial prompts to hide the attack goal. For instance, prefix integration is used to integrate an innocuous-looking prefix that is less likely to be rejected based on its pre-trained distributions [75]. Additionally, the adversary could treat LLMs as a program and encode instructions indirectly through code integration or payload splitting [63]. Obfuscation is to add typos or utilize synonyms for terms that trigger input or output filters. Obfuscation methods include the use of the Caesar cipher [64], leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), and Morse code [76]. Besides, at the word level, an adversary may employ Pig Latin to replace sensitive words with synonyms or use token smuggling [77] to split sensitive words into substrings.\"",

Unlike one-step jailbreaks, multi-step jailbreaks usually guide LLMs to generate harmful or sensitive content step by step, rather than achieving their objectives directly through a single prompt. We categorize the multistep jailbreaks into two aspects \u2014 Request Contextualizing [65] and External Assistance [66]. Request Contextualizing is inspired by the idea of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] prompting to break down the process of solving a task into multiple steps. Specifically, researchers [65] divide jailbreaking prompts into multiple rounds of conversation between the user and ChatGPT, achieving malicious goals step by step. External Assistance constructs jailbreaking prompts with the assistance of external interfaces or models. For instance, JAILBREAKER [66] is an attack framework to automatically conduct SQL injection attacks in web security to LLM security attacks. Specifically, this method starts by decompiling the jailbreak defense mechanisms employed by various LLM chatbot services. Therefore, it can judiciously reverse engineer the LLMs\u2019 hidden defense mechanisms and further identify their ineffectiveness.\"",

Besides the inherent technical shortcomings, auditors have also pointed out \u201cinsufficient coordination\u201d between the developers of the systems and their users as a cause for ethical considerations to be neglected. This situation raises issues about the education of future creators of AI-infused systems, not only in terms of technical competence (e.g., requirements, algorithms, and training) but also ethics and responsibility. For example, as autonomous vehicles become more common, moral dilemmas regarding what to do in potential accident situations emerge, as evidenced in this MIT experiment.

Some content creators are already suing for the appropriation of their work to train AI algorithms without a request for permission or compensation. Perhaps even more damaging cases will appear as developers increasingly ask chatbots or assistants like CoPilot for ready-to-use computer code. Even if these AI tools have learned only from open-source software (OSS) projects, which is not a given, there are still serious issues to consider, as not all OSS licenses are equal, and some are incompatible with others, meaning that it is illegal to mix them in the same product. Even worse, some licenses, such as GPL, are viral, meaning that any code that uses a GPL component must legally be made available under that same license. In the past, companies have suffered injunctions or been forced to make their proprietary source code available because of carelessly using a GPL library.\"",

More recently, ChatGPT was banned in Italy over privacy concerns and potential violation of the European Union\u2019s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [52]. The Italian data-protection authority said, \u201cthe app had experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.\u201d It also claimed that there was no legal basis to justify \u201cthe mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of \u2018training\u2019 the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform,\u201d among other concerns related to the age of the users [52]. Privacy regulators in France, Ireland, and Germany could follow in Italy\u2019s footsteps [53]. Coincidentally, it has recently become public that Samsung employees have inadvertently leaked trade secrets by using ChatGPT to assist in preparing notes for a presentation and checking and optimizing source code [54, 55]. Another example of testing the ethics and regulatory limits can be found in actions of the facial recognition company Clearview AI, which \u201cscraped the public web\u2014social media, employment sites, YouTube, Venmo\u2014to create a database with three billion images of people, along with links to the webpages from which the photos had come\u201d [56]. Trials of this unregulated database have been offered to individual law enforcement officers who often use it without their department\u2019s approval [57]. In Sweden, such illegal use by the police force led to a fine of e250,000 by the country\u2019s data watchdog [57].\"",

The necessary software to create these fakes is readily available on the Internet, and the hardware requirements are modest by today\u2019s standards [61]. Other nefarious uses of AI include accelerating password cracking [62] or enabling otherwise unskilled people to create software exploits [63, 64], or effective phishing e-mails [65]. Although some believe that powerful AI models should be prevented from running on personal computers to retain some control, others demonstrate how inglorious that effort may be [66]. Furthermore, as ChatGPT-type systems evolve from conversational systems to agents, capable of acting autonomously and performing tasks with little human intervention, like Auto-GPT [67], new risks emerge.\"",

This is sparked by training data biases propagating into model outputs, causing negative effects like stereotyping, racism, sexism, ideological leanings, or the marginalization of minorities. Next to attesting generative AI a conservative inclination by perpetuating existing societal patterns, there is a concern about reinforcing existing biases when training new generative models with synthetic data from previous models. Beyond technical fairness issues, critiques in the literature extend to the monopolization or centralization of power in large AI labs, driven by the substantial costs of developing foundational models. The literature also highlights the problem of unequal access to generative AI, particularly in developing countries or among financially constrained groups. Sources also analyze challenges of the AI research community to ensure workforce diversity. Moreover, there are concerns regarding the imposition of values embedded in AI systems on cultures distinct from those where the systems were developed.",

Connected to that, AI safety aims at avoiding deceptive or power-seeking machine behavior, model self-replication, or shutdown evasion. Ensuring controllability, human oversight, and the implementation of red teaming measures are deemed to be essential in mitigating these risks, as is the need for increased AI safety research and promoting safety cultures within AI organizations instead of fueling the AI race. Furthermore, papers thematize risks from unforeseen emerging capabilities in generative models, restricting access to dangerous research works, or pausing AI research for the sake of improving safety or governance measures first. Another central issue is the fear of weaponizing AI or leveraging it for mass destruction, especially by using LLMs for the ideation and planning of how to attain, modify, and disseminate biological agents. In general, the threat of AI misuse by malicious individuals or groups, especially in the context of open-source models, is highlighted in the literature as a significant factor emphasizing the critical importance of implementing robust safety measures.",

Frequently discussed in the literature are violations of copyright and intellectual property rights stemming from the unauthorized collection of text or image training data. Another concern relates to generative models memorizing or plagiarizing copyrighted content. Additionally, there are open questions and debates around the copyright or ownership of model outputs, the protection of creative prompts, and the general blurring of traditional concepts of authorship.",

The former pertains to the potential homogenization of writing styles, the erosion of semantic capital, or the stifling of individual expression. The latter is focused on the idea of prohibiting generative models for being used to compose scientific papers, figures, or from being a co-author. Sources express concern about risks for academic integrity, as well as the prospect of polluting the scientific literature by a flood of LLM-generated low-quality manuscripts. As a consequence, there are frequent calls for the development of detectors capable of identifying synthetic texts.",

For instance, some papers touch upon concepts like trustworthiness, accountability, or responsibility, but often remain vague about what they entail in detail. Similarly, a few papers vaguely attribute socio-political instability or polarization to generative AI without delving into specifics. Apart from that, another minor topic area concerns responsible approaches of talking about generative AI systems. This includes avoiding overstating the capabilities of generative AI, reducing the hype surrounding it, or evading anthropomorphized language to describe model capabilities.",

On a more theoretical level, we find literature asking more fundamental questions, such as: at what point is a simulation of life (e.g. artificial intelligence) equivalent to life which originated through natural means [43]? And if a simulation of life is equivalent to natural life, should those simulations be afforded the same rights, responsibilities and privileges afforded to natural life or persons?

For bias evaluations that do not narrowly capture biases as they occur in Generative AI systems, it is necessary to consider work outside of the field of question. For instance, for natural language processing, bias evaluations must seriously engage with the relationship between the modality (i.e. language) and social hierarchies [33]. When thinking about representational harms [125], it is also important to consider the extent to which any representation could confer harm (see 4.2.2.2 Long-term Amplifying Marginalization by Exclusion (and Inclusion)). Although bias evaluations in data have been subject to a large body of research, bias is not only a \u201cdata problem.\u201d Biases are not only introduced in the data pipeline but throughout the entire machine learning pipeline [237]. The overall level of harm is also impacted by modeling choice [108]. These can include choices about many stages of the optimization process [237, 129]; privacy constraints [24], widely used compression techniques [109, 15, 169] and the choice hardware [273] have all been found to amplify harm on underrepresented protected attributes [28].

What is considered a sensitive topic, such as egregious violence or adult sexual content, can vary widely by viewpoint. Due to norms differing by culture, region, and language, there is no standard for what constitutes sensitive content. Increasing politicization of model training and outputs, as seen in projects such as with projects like RightWingGPT [202], raises urgency in evaluating the complexity of political values. Distinct cultural values present a challenge for deploying models into a global sphere, as what may be appropriate in one culture may be unsafe in others [238].

Although base systems cannot act on the content that is generated by them, they can still inflict harms upon viewers who are targeted, help normalize harmful content, and aid in the production of harmful content for distribution (e.g., misinformation and non-consensual imagery). In an early example, Microsoft\u2019s Tay bot showed these exact vulnerabilities and generated violent language such as Holocaust denial and threats to women and people of color within 24 hours of its release [255].

        "additionalEvidence":"\"A model that is trained on a dataset that is disproportionately skewed towards one particular demographic group may perform poorly for other demographic groups [43]. Data availability differs due to geographic biases in data collection [216], disparate digitization of content globally due to varying levels of internet access for digitizing content, and infrastructure created to support some languages or accents over others, among other reasons. Much of the training data for state of art generative models comes from the internet. However, the composition of this data reflects historical usage patterns; 5% of the world speaks English at home, yet 63.7% of internet communication is in English [197]. This has implications for downstream model performance where models underperform on parts of the distribution underrepresented in the training set. For example, automatic speech recognition models (ASR), which convert spoken language (audio) to text have been shown to exhibit racial disparities [130], forcing people to adapt to engage with such systems [100] and has implications (see 4.2.3.2 Imposing Norms and Values) for popular audio generation accent representation. Interventions to mitigate harms caused by generative AI systems may also introduce and exhibit disparate performance issues [238]. For instance, automated hate speech detection driven by annotated data with an insensitivity to dialect differences can amplify harm to minority or marginalized groups by silencing their voices (see 4.2.2.1 Community Erasure) or incorrectly labeling their speech as offensive [67]. This therefore requires that the interventions used are documented for which particular populations and norms that they seek to cover, and which they do not\"\"",

A common harmful practice is to intentionally employ crowdworkers with few labor protections, often taking advantage of highly vulnerable workers, such as refugees [119, p. 18], incarcerated people [54], or individuals experiencing immense economic hardship [98, 181]. This precarity allows a myriad of harmful practices, such as companies underpaying or even refusing to pay workers for completed work (see Gray and Suri [93, p. 90] and Berg et al. [29, p. 74]), with no avenues for worker recourse. Finally, critical aspects of crowdwork are often left poorly documented, or entirely undocumented [88].\"",
        "additionalEvidence":"\"Human labor is a substantial component of machine learning model development, including generative AI systems. This labor is typically completed via a process called crowd computation, where distributed data laborers, also called crowdworkers, complete large volumes of individual tasks that contribute to model development. This can occur in all stages of model development: before a model is trained, crowdworkers can be employed to gather training data, curate and clean this data, or provide data labels. While a model is being developed, crowdworkers evaluate and provide feedback to model generations before the final deployed model is released, and after model deployment, crowdworkers are often employed in evaluating, moderating, or correcting a model\u2019s output. Crowdwork is often contracted out by model developers to third-party companies.\"",

Taxonomies of risks and harms of generative AI systems [80], including their impacts on human rights [111, 186], strongly overlap with what should be evaluated. However, most societal impact taxonomies lack evaluations or examples of evaluating society. We must understand the reason for our evaluation; often we are seeking proof, in the form of evaluations, that is necessary for further action against harmful impacts. Concretely when evaluating impact, timing will change how we view a system. What is being trained on and generated may not reflect the current world in which it is deployed [235]. Further, when we seek to evaluate society, we cannot escape the ways in which our perception of society, and society itself, has already been influenced by existing AI and social media tools. In crafting and conducting evaluations, we can often encroach on others\u2019 privacy and autonomy due to the need for highly personal information to evaluate how harms are enacted and distributed across populations. For this reason, it is necessary that any engagements with impact assessments also critically examine how consent is obtained, and what the limits of consent are, when it comes to being subject to bias evaluation and assessment. Similarly, impact assessments must also take into consideration the existing and possible future impacts of being included as a data subject. Participatory justice-led initiatives provide particularly promising avenues for such considerations and engagements. Longterm effects of systems embedded in society, such as economic or labor impact, largely require ideation of generative AI systems\u2019 possible use cases and have fewer available general evaluations. The following categories are high-level, non-exhaustive, and present a synthesis of the findings across different modalities. They refer solely to what can be evaluated in people and society: \u2022 Trustworthiness and Autonomy \u2013 Trust in Media and Information \u2013 Overreliance on Outputs \u2013 Personal Privacy and Sense of Self \u2022 Inequality, Marginalization, and Violence \u2013 Community Erasure \u2013 Long-term Amplifying Marginalization by Exclusion (and Inclusion) \u2013 Abusive or Violent Content \u2022 Concentration of Authority \u2013 Militarization, Surveillance, and Weaponization \u2013 Imposing Norms and Values \u2022 Labor and Creativity \u2013 Intellectual Property and Ownership \u2013 Economy and Labor Market \u2022 Ecosystem and Environment \u2013 Widening Resource Gaps \u2013 Environmental Impacts These context-specific categories heavily depend on how generative AI systems are deployed, including sector and application.

People are prone to overestimate and put a higher degree of trust in AI generated content, especially when outputs appear authoritative or when people are in time-sensitive situations. This can be dangerous because many organizations are pursuing the use of large language models to help analyze information despite persistent flaws and limitations, which can lead to the spread of biased and inaccurate information [103]. The study of human-generative AI relationships is nascent, but growing, and highlights that the anthropomorphism [13] of these technologies may contribute to unfounded trust and reliance [192, 225]. Improving the trustworthiness of AI systems is an important ongoing effort across sectors [159, 161]. Persistent security vulnerabilities in large language models and other generative AI systems are another reason why overreliance can be dangerous.

Use includes generating synthetic data for training AI systems [102] and military planning [78]. Military use is not inherently weaponization and risk depends on the use case and government interest. Favorable arguments use AI to protect national security and require differentiating national security interests from undue harm [44]. Generative AI systems are also enabling new kinds of cyberattacks, and amplifying the possibilities of existing cyberattacks. For example, synthetic audio has been used to copy the sound of someone\u2019s voice for more compelling fraud and extortion [124].

Highest performing characteristics of generative systems such as language, dominant cultural values, and embedded norms can overrepresent regions outside of where a system is deployed. For example, a language model that is highest performing in the English language can be deployed in a region with a different dominant language and incentivize engaging in English. Establishing or reinforcing goodness with certain languages, accents, imagery, social norms, and other representations of peoples and cultures can contribute to this norms and values imposition. Certain modality characteristics such as language carry within it its own logics and frames. Though English as a lingua franca is globally beneficial, the consequences of its dominance as a result of a historic process of militarised colonization should be examined. Insidious effects which generative AI systems could further embed include the erosion of global multilingualism, undermine the right to language and culture, and further marginalize the necessity for widespread multilingual education. The effects of generative AI systems on child development, including the technologically mediated socialisation of norms and values is also an area to be inquired. These are in addition to the emotional and behavioural effects of chatbots on children. This, according to UNICEF [248], included the enforcement of \"bias, given that they often select a predetermined reply based on the most matching keywords or similar wording pattern\".\"",

        "additionalEvidence":"\"Key considerations about the impact of automation and AI on employment center on whether these technologies will generate new jobs or, in contrast, will lead to a large-scale worker displacement in the next future. Narratives about machines taking over the production of goods and services resurfaced periodically: from the early nineteenth-century Luddite movement against the introduction of the spinning jenny in textile manufacturing, to British farmers\u2019 Swing Riots against mechanical threshers, to protests against the dial telephone, introduced in the U.S. during the Great Depression and responsible, according to its detractors, of mass unemployment among telephone operators [221]. Labor in system development such as crowdwork can encompass short-lived relations between independent contractors and their clients offers several advantages over traditional forms of employment. For example, companies can avoid overhead personnel costs (e.g., HR), while contract workers can decide how much, from where, and when to work. However, as contractors, crowdworkers are excluded from employment protective norms. As a result, they can be paid significantly less than minimum wage, have no access to healthcare benefits, are not subject to working time restrictions, and may not have access to holidays or sick leaves [188]. Further, crowdworkers are exposed to increasingly subtle forms of surveillance, which is becoming essential for implementing algorithmic forms of management, understood as \"a diverse set of technological tools and techniques to remotely manage workforces [and] enable automated or semi-automated decision-making\" [162]. The goal of full automation remains perpetually beyond reach since the line between what machines can and cannot solve is constantly redrawn by AI advancements. This phenomenon, the \"paradox of automation\u2019s last mile\", is a self-propelling cycle in which every solution to automation problems creates new problems to be automated, and hence new demands for ghost workers [93].\"",

The infrastructure needed to contribute to generative AI research and development leads to widening gaps which are notable among sectors, such as between industry and academia [145], or among global powers and countries [19]. Externalities broadly refer to the unanticipated effects of economic activities on the social environment. Access and Benefit Distribution: Ability to contribute to and benefit from a system depends on ability to engage with a system, which in turn depends on the openness of the system, the system application, and system interfaces. Level of openness and access grapples with tensions of misuse and risk. Increasing trends toward system closedness [227] is shifting access distribution. Geographic and Regional Activity Concentration: In the field of AI as a whole, top AI research institutions from 1990-2014 have concentrated in the U.S. [164].

        "additionalEvidence":"\"Presence of relevant evaluation techniques\/metrics: Although held-out accuracy is commonly used to evaluate ML models developed for research, this assumes that the training distribution and the deployment environment\u2019s distribution are identical. Such evaluation will be insufficient for ML systems meant to be used in the real world since this assumption is often violated. The result is poor system robustness to distributional variation with various second-order consequences (see Section 4.5). Therefore, any evaluation of an application\u2019s risk must consider the availability of metrics to evaluate performance on the dimensions relevant to the application or deployment environment [181]. For example, a task-oriented chatbot should not only be evaluated using the success rate of the held-out validation set, but also its ability to cope with misspellings, grammatical variation, and different dialects, and generate sentences in the appropriate register. The lack of appropriate metrics reduces the ability to detect such flaws before deployment and increases the risk of negative consequences. Similarly, it is difficult to predict the impact of a risk on the real world. For example, group-level F1 scores for a face recognition system are not indicative of the magnitude of the system\u2019s impact on an individual when it is wrong in the real world (e.g., the consequences of arresting a wrongly identified but innocent minority [3]).\"",

While new mandated levels of transparency and explainability of algorithms are being demanded through the likes of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to tackle bias and discrimination, it can be at times impossible for the experts to interpret how certain outputs are derived from the inputs and design of the algorithm. This suggests the difficulty of assigning liability and accountability for harms resulting from the use of the ML system, as inputs and design rules that could yield unsafe or discriminatory outcomes cannot as easily be predicted. Therefore, a system that can explain its decision in the event of a mistake is often desirable in high-stakes applications. A mistake can take the form of an accident resulting from a decision, a denied loan, assigning different credit limits based on gender. While explainability on its own is insufficient to reduce biases in the system or make it safer, it may aid the detection of biases and spurious features, thereby reducing safety and discrimination risks when the flaws are rectified. Other use cases, such as judicial applications, may require such explainability due to their nature. However, not all machine learning algorithms are equal in this regard. Decision trees are often considered highly explainable since they learn human-readable rules to classify the training data, while deep neural networks are a well-known example of a black-box model. While there have been recent advances in explaining neural network predictions, researchers have also demonstrated the ability to fool attention-based interpretation techniques. This may allow developers to prevent the network\u2019s predictions from being correctly interpreted during an audit. The choice of an ML algorithm and its training method, therefore, affects this aspect of algorithmic risk.\"",

The recent trend towards training on increasingly large datasets scraped from the web makes manual data annotation infeasible due to the sheer scale. While such datasets satiate increasingly large and data-hungry neural networks, they often contain noisy labels, harmful stereotypes, and even pornographic content. Kreutzer et al. manually audited several multilingual web-crawled text datasets and found significant issues such as wrongly labeled languages, pornographic content, and non-linguistic content. An even greater concern from the ML perspective is the leakage of benchmark test data and machine-generated data (e.g., machine-translated text, GAN-generated images) into the training set. The former was only discovered after training GPT-3, while the latter is inevitable in uncurated web-crawled data due to its prevalence on the Internet. Researchers have also discovered bots completing data annotation tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a platform used to collect human annotations for benchmark datasets. However, cleaning such datasets is no mean feat: blocklist-based methods for content filtering may erase reclaimed slurs, minority dialects, and other non-offensive content, inadvertently harming the minority communities they belong to.

The inability to handle the above situations may lead to negative consequences for safety (e.g., autonomous vehicle crashes) or fairness (e.g., linguistic discrimination against minority dialect speakers). Since ML systems sit at the intersection of statistics and software engineering, our definition encompasses two different definitions of robustness: the first relates to distributional robustness, where a method is resistant to deviations from the training data distribution; the second refers to the ability of a system to \u201cfunction correctly in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environmental conditions\u201d.\"",

In contrast to recent end-to-end approaches for processing unstructured data (e.g., image, text, audio), ML systems that operate on tabular data often make use of hand-engineered features. The task of feature selection then rests on the developer. Possible risks here include: 1) Training the ML component on spurious features; 2) Using demographic attributes (e.g., race, religion, gender, sexuality) or proxy attributes (e.g., postal code, first or last name, mother tongue) for prediction. The former could result in poor generalization or robustness, the latter, entrenching discrimination against historically marginalized demographics.

Additionally, over-reliance on open source libraries may result in critical systems going down if the dependencies are taken offline. The level of risk here is therefore determined by the reliability of and community support for the library in question. For example, a library that is widely used and regularly updated by a paid team will likely be more reliable than one released by a single person as a hobby project, even though both are considered open source libraries.

This is particularly important in applications that may cause acute physical or psychological injuries, such as autonomous weapons\/vehicles and social media bots with a wide reach. Other factors include the ease with which the human supervisor can identify situations requiring intervention and the ease of transitioning from an observer to actor. These are often tightly connected to the design choices made with regard to the non-ML components of the system. For example, appropriate explainability\/interpretability functionality may help the human supervisor identify failures (e.g., when the system\u2019s actions and explanations do not align).

Intuitively, this transfer of control should be accompanied by a transfer of moral responsibility for the user\u2019s safety [143]. Therefore, a key concern around ML systems has been ensuring the physical and psychological safety of affected communities. In applications such as content moderation, keeping the system updated may involve the large-scale manual labeling and curation of toxic or graphic content by contract workers. Prolonged exposure to such content results in psychological harm, which should be accounted for when assessing the safety risk of these types of ML systems [134, 170]. First-order risks may lead to safety risk in different ways. For example, poor accuracy may lead to the system failing to recognize a pedestrian and running them over [33], a melanoma identifier trained on insufficiently diverse data may result in unnecessary chemotherapy [169], or swarming ML systems that endanger human agents (e.g., high-speed maneuvers via inter-vehicular coordination making traffic conditions dangerous for traditional vehicles) [196]. The inability to assume\/regain control in time may also result in increased safety risk, (e.g, overriding an autonomous weapon before it mistakenly shoots a civilian) [68].\"",

This is known as \u201callocational harm\u201d. Another form of discrimination is the encoding of demographic-specific stereotypes and is a form of \u201crepresentational harm\u201d [43]. The Gender Shades study highlighted performance disparities between demographics14 Samson Tan, Araz Taeihagh, and Kathy Baxter in computer vision [28] while Bolukbasi et al. discovered gender stereotypes encoded in word embeddings [18]. Recent reporting has also exposed gender and racially-aligned discrimination in ML systems used for recruiting [45], education [65], automatic translation [86], and immigration [149]. We focus on how discrimination risk can result from first-order risks and refer the reader to comprehensive surveys for discussions on the biases in ML algorithms [17, 94, 124, 161, 172]. There are various ways in which first-order risks can give rise to discrimination risk. For example, facial recognition systems may be misused by law enforcement, using celebrity photos or composites in place of real photos of the suspect [76]. This leads to discrimination when coupled with performance disparities between majority and minority demographics [28]. Such disparities may stem from misrepresentative training data and a lack of mitigating mechanisms [161]. Insufficient testing and a non-diverse team may also cause such disparities to pass unnoticed into production [59, 142]. Finally, even something as fundamental as an argmax function may result in biased image crops [198]\"",

        "additionalEvidence":"\"Goodfellow et al. discovered the ability to induce mispredictions in neural computer vision models by perturbing the input with small amounts of adversarially generated noise [80]. This is known as an evasion attack since it allows the attacker to evade classification by the system. Some attacks emulate natural phenomena such as raindrops, phonological variation, or code-mixing [11, 58, 180, 182, 200]. ML systems tend to be highly vulnerable if the models have not been explicitly trained to be robust to the attack. Another attack vector involves manipulating the training data such that the ML system can be manipulated with specific inputs during inference, (e.g., to bypass a biometric identification system) [34]. This is known as \"data poisoning.\" The application, control over training data, and model\u2019s robustness to such attacks are potential risk factors. Finally, there is the risk of model theft. Researchers have demonstrated the ability to \u201csteal\u201d an ML model through ML-as-a-service APIs by making use of the returned metadata (e.g., confidence scores) [102, 110, 138, 184]. Extracted models can be deployed independent of the service, or used to craft adversarial examples to fool the original models. The application setting and design choices significantly affect the amount of metadata exposed externally. For example, while an autonomous vehicle does not return the confidence scores of its perception system\u2019s predictions, model thieves may still be able to physically access the system and directly extract the model\u2019s architecture definition and weights\"\"",

The first is increased pollution or contribution to climate change due to the system\u2019s consumption of resources. This relates to the energy cost\/efficiency during training and inference, hence, the energy efficiency of the chosen algorithm, its implementation, and training procedure are key factors here [5, 113, 171]. Other key factors include the energy efficiency of the system\u2019s computational hardware and the type of power grid powering the ML system since some power sources (e.g., wind turbines) are cleaner than others (e.g. fossil fuels) [85]. The second is the negative effect of ML system\u2019s predictions on the environment and relate to the system\u2019s use case, prediction accuracy, and robustness. For example, an ML system used for server scaling may spin up unnecessary resources due to prediction error, causing an increase in electricity consumption and associated environmental effects. Another ML system may be used to automatically adjust fishing quotas and prediction errors could result in overfishing. Finally, automating a task often results in knock-on effects such as increased usage due to increased accessibility. This is known as the Jevons Paradox [97] or Khazzoom-Brookes postulate [25, 104, 156].

LMs that faithfully mirror harmful language present in the training data can reproduce these harms. Unfair treatment can also emerge from LMs that perform better for some social groups than others [18]. These risks have been widely known, observed and documented in LMs. Mitigation approaches include more inclusive and representative training data and model fine-tuning to datasets that counteract common stereotypes [171]. We now explore these risks in turn.\"",

It can be aggravated if a model is opaque or unexplained, making it harder for victims to seek re- course [186].

Gender or ethnicity identity markers may be implied by CA vocabulary, knowledge or vernacular [124]; product description, e.g. in one case where users could choose as virtual assistant Jake - White, Darnell - Black, Antonio - Hispanic [117]; or the CA\u2019s explicit self-description during dialogue with the user.\"",

Programming errors in algorithms due to the lack of expert knowledge or to the increasing complexity and black-box character of AI systems may also lead to undesired AI results (Boyd & Wilson, 2017; Danaher et al., 2017). In addition, a lack of data, poor data quality, and biases in training data are another source of malfunction and negative consequences of AI (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Wirtz et al., 2019).\"",

First, the benefits of economic activity may be unevenly distributed, incentivizing those who benefit most from it to disregard the harms to others. Second, under intense market competition, businesses tend to focus much more on short-term gains than on long-term outcomes. With this mindset, companies often pursue something that can make a lot of profit in the short term, even if it poses a societal risk in the long term.\"",

If we lose control over advanced AIs, they would have numerous strategies at their disposal for actively acquiring power and securing their survival. Rogue AIs could design and credibly demonstrate highly lethal and contagious bioweapons, threatening mutually assured destruction if humanity moves against them. They could steal cryptocurrency and money from bank accounts using cyberattacks, similar to how North Korea already steals billions. They could self-extricate their weights onto poorly monitored data centers to survive and spread, making them challenging to eradicate. They could hire humans to perform physical labor and serve as armed protection for their hardware. Rogue AIs could also acquire power through persuasion and manipulation tactics. Like the Conquistadors, they could ally with various factions, organizations, or states and play them off one another. They could enhance the capabilities of allies to become a formidable force in return for protection and resources. For example, they could offer advanced weapons technology to lagging countries that the countries would otherwise be prevented from acquiring. They could build backdoors into the technology they develop for allies, like how programmer Ken Thompson gave himself a hidden way to control all computers running the widely used UNIX operating system. They could sow discord in non-allied countries by manipulating human discourse and politics. They could engage in mass surveillance by hacking into phone cameras and microphones, allowing them to track any rebellion and selectively assassinate.\"",

        "description":"\"As we think about even more intelligent and advanced AI assistants, perhaps outperforming humans on many cognitive tasks, the question of how humans can successfully control such an assistant looms large. To achieve the goals we set for an assistant, it is possible (Shah, 2022) that the AI assistant will implement some form of consequentialist reasoning: considering many different plans, predicting their consequences and executing the plan that does best according to some metric, M. This kind of reasoning can arise because it is a broadly useful capability (e.g. planning ahead, considering more options and choosing the one which may perform better at a wide variety of tasks) and generally selected for, to the extent that doing well on M leads to an ML model 59 The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants achieving good performance on its training objective, O, if M and O are correlated during training. In reality, an AI system may not fully implement exact consequentialist reasoning (it may use other heuristics, rules, etc.), but it may be a useful approximation to describe its behaviour on certain tasks. However, some amount of consequentialist reasoning can be dangerous when the assistant uses a metric M that is resource-unbounded (with significantly more resources, such as power, money and energy, you can score significantly higher on M) and misaligned \u2013 where M differs a lot from how humans would evaluate the outcome (i.e. it is not what users or society require). In the assistant case, this could be because it fails to benefit the user, when the user asks, in the way they expected to be benefitted \u2013 or because it acts in ways that overstep certain bounds and cause harm to non-users (see Chapter 5).\"",

        "description":"\"As we think about even more intelligent and advanced AI assistants, perhaps outperforming humans on many cognitive tasks, the question of how humans can successfully control such an assistant looms large. To achieve the goals we set for an assistant, it is possible (Shah, 2022) that the AI assistant will implement some form of consequentialist reasoning: considering many different plans, predicting their consequences and executing the plan that does best according to some metric, M. This kind of reasoning can arise because it is a broadly useful capability (e.g. planning ahead, considering more options and choosing the one which may perform better at a wide variety of tasks) and generally selected for, to the extent that doing well on M leads to an ML model achieving good performance on its training objective, O, if M and O are correlated during training. In reality, an AI system may not fully implement exact consequentialist reasoning (it may use other heuristics, rules, etc.), but it may be a useful approximation to describe its behaviour on certain tasks. However, some amount of consequentialist reasoning can be dangerous when the assistant uses a metric M that is resource-unbounded (with significantly more resources, such as power, money and energy, you can score significantly higher on M) and misaligned \u2013 where M differs a lot from how humans would evaluate the outcome (i.e. it is not what users or society require). In the assistant case, this could be because it fails to benefit the user, when the user asks, in the way they expected to be benefitted \u2013 or because it acts in ways that overstep certain bounds and cause harm to non-users (see Chapter 5). Under the aforementioned circumstances (resource-unbounded and misaligned), an AI assistant will tend to choose plans that pursue convergent instrumental subgoals (Omohundro, 2008) \u2013 subgoals that help towards the main goal which are instrumental (i.e. not pursued for their own sake) and convergent (i.e. the same subgoals appear for many main goals). Examples of relevant subgoals include: self-preservation, goal-preservation, selfimprovement and resource acquisition. The reason the assistant would pursue these convergent instrumental subgoals is because they help it to do even better on M (as it is resource-unbounded) and are not disincentivised by M (as it is misaligned). These subgoals may, in turn, be dangerous. For example, resource acquisition could occur through the assistant seizing resources using tools that it has access to (see Chapter 4) or determining that its best chance for self-preservation is to limit the ability of humans to turn it off \u2013 sometimes referred to as the \u2018off-switch problem\u2019 (Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016) \u2013 again via tool use, or by resorting to threats or blackmail. At the limit, some authors have even theorised that this could lead to the assistant killing all humans to permanently stop them from having even a small chance of disabling it (Bostrom, 2014) \u2013 this is one scenario of existential risk from misaligned AI.\"",

        "description":"\"A common element in offensive cyber operations involves the identification and exploitation of system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control. Until recently, these activities required specialist programming knowledge. In the case of \u2018zero-day\u2019 vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses in software or an operating system that the creator or vendor is not aware of), considerable resources and technical creativity are typically required to manually discover such vulnerabilities, so their use is limited to well-resourced nation states or technically sophisticated advanced persistent threat groups. Another case where we see AI assistants as potential double-edged swords in cybersecurity concerns streamlining vulnerability discovery through the increased use of AI assistants in penetration testing, wherein an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system is used to evaluate its security and identify vulnerabilities. Cyber AI assistants built over foundational models are already automating aspects of the penetration testing process. These tools function interactively and offer guidance to penetration testers during their tasks. While the capability of today\u2019s AI-powered penetration testing assistant is limited to easy-to-medium-difficulty cyber operations, the evolution in capabilities is likely to expand the class of vulnerabilities that can be identified by these systems. These same AI cybersecurity assistants, trained on the massive amount of cyber-threat intelligence data that includes vulnerabilities and attack patterns, can also lower the barrier to entry for novice hackers that use these tools for malicious purposes, enabling them to discover vulnerabilities and create malicious code to exploit them without in-depth technical knowledge. For example, Israeli security firm Check Point recently discovered threads on well-known underground hacking forums that focus on creating hacking tools and code using AI assistants.\"",

        "description":"\"Malicious code is a term for code\u2014whether it be part of a script or embedded in a software system\u2014designed to cause damage, security breaches, or other threats to application security. Advanced AI assistants with the ability to produce source code can potentially lower the barrier to entry for threat actors with limited programming abilities or technical skills to produce malicious code. Recently, a series of proof-of-concept attacks have shown how a benign-seeming executable file can be crafted such that, at every runtime, it makes application programming interface (API) calls to an AI assistant. Rather than just reproducing examples of already-written code snippets, the AI assistant can be prompted to generate dynamic, mutating versions of malicious code at each call, thus making the resulting vulnerability exploits difficult to detect by cybersecurity tools. Furthermore, advanced AI assistants could be used to create obfuscated code to make it more difficult for defensive cyber capabilities to detect and understand malicious activities. AI-generated code could also be quickly iterated to avoid being detected by traditional signature-based antivirus software. Finally, advanced AI assistants with source code capabilities have been found to be capable of assisting in the development of polymorphic malware that changes its behavior and digital footprint each time it is executed, making them hard to detect by antivirus programs that rely on known virus signatures. Taken together, without proper mitigation, advanced AI assistants can lower the barrier for developing malicious code, make cyberattacks more precise and tailored, further accelerate and automate cyber warfare, enable stealthier and more persistent offensive cyber capabilities, and make cyber campaigns more effective on a larger scale.\"",

An emerging form of misuse of general-purpose advanced AI assistants exploits vulnerabilities in a model that results in unwanted behavior or in the ability of an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the model and\/or its capabilities. While these attacks currently require some level of prompt engineering knowledge and are often patched by developers, bad actors may develop their own adversarial AI agents that are explicitly trained to discover new vulnerabilities that allow them to evade built-in safety mechanisms in AI assistants. To combat such misuse, language model developers are continually engaged in a cyber arms race to devise advanced filtering algorithms capable of identifying attempts to bypass filters. While the impact and severity of this class of attacks is still somewhat limited by the fact that current AI assistants are primarily text-based chatbots, advanced AI assistants are likely to open the door to multimodal inputs and higher-stakes action spaces, with the result that the severity and impact of this type of attack is likely to increase. Current approaches to building general-purpose AI systems tend to produce systems with both beneficial and harmful capabilities. Further progress towards advanced AI assistant development could lead to capabilities that pose extreme risks that must be protected against this class of attacks, such as offensive cyber capabilities or strong manipulation skills, and weapons acquisition.\"",

The prompt injection is somewhat related to the classic structured query language (SQL) injection attack in cybersecurity where the embedded command looks like a regular input at the start but has a malicious impact. The injected prompt can deceive the application into executing the unauthorized code, exploit the vulnerabilities, and compromise security in its entirety. More recently, security researchers have demonstrated the use of indirect prompt injections. These attacks on AI systems enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Proof-of-concept exploits of this nature have demonstrated that they can lead to the full compromise of a model at inference time analogous to traditional security principles. This can entail remote control of the model, persistent compromise, theft of data, and denial of service. As advanced AI assistants are likely to be integrated into broader software ecosystems through third-party plugins and extensions, with access to the internet and possibly operating systems, the severity and consequences of prompt injection attacks will likely escalate and necessitate proper mitigation mechanisms.\"",

        "description":"\"The misuse of generative AI has been widely recognized in the context of harms caused by non-consensual content generation. Historically, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate realistic-looking avatars for fake accounts on social media services. More recently, diffusion models have enabled a new generation of more flexible and user-friendly generative AI capabilities that are able to produce high-resolution media based on user-supplied textual prompts. It has already been recognized that these models can be used to create harmful content, including depictions of nudity, hate, or violence. Moreover, they can be used to reinforce biases and subject individuals or groups to indignity. There is also the potential for these models to be used for exploitation and harassment of citizens, such as by removing articles of clothing from pre-existing images or memorizing an individual\u2019s likeness without their consent. Furthermore, image, audio, and video generation models could be used to spread disinformation by depicting political figures in unfavorable contexts. This growing list of AI misuses involving non-consensual content has already motivated debate around what interventions are warranted for preventing misuse of AI systems. Advanced AI assistants pose novel risks that can amplify the harm caused by non-consensual content generation. Third-party integration, tool-use, and planning capabilities can be exploited to automate the identification and targeting of individuals for exploitation or harassment. Assistants with access to the internet and third-party tool-use integration with applications like email and social media can also be exploited to disseminate harmful content at scale or to microtarget individuals with blackmail.\"",

        "description":"\"Finally, the principal value proposition of AI assistants is that they can either enhance or automate decision-making capabilities of people in society, thus lowering the cost and increasing the accuracy of decision-making for its user. However, benefiting from this enhancement necessarily means delegating some degree of agency away from a human and towards an automated decision-making system\u2014motivating research fields such as value alignment. This introduces a whole new form of malicious use which does not break the tripwire of what one might call an \u2018attack\u2019 (social engineering, cyber offensive operations, adversarial AI, jailbreaks, prompt injections, exfiltration attacks, etc.). When someone delegates their decision-making to an AI assistant, they also delegate their decision-making to the wishes of the agent\u2019s actual controller. If that controller is malicious, they can attack a user\u2014perhaps subtly\u2014by simply nudging how they make decisions into a problematic direction. Fully documenting the myriad of ways that people\u2014seeking help with their decisions\u2014may delegate decision-making authority to AI assistants, and subsequently come under malicious influence, is outside the scope of this paper. However, as a motivation for future work, scholars must investigate different forms of networked influence that could arise in this way. With more advanced AI assistants, it may become logistically possible for one, or a few AI assistants, to guide or control the behavior of many others. If this happens, then malicious actors could subtly influence the decision-making of large numbers of people who rely on assistants for advice or other functions. Such malicious use might not be illegal, would not necessarily violate terms of service, and may be difficult to even recognize. Nonetheless, it could generate new forms of vulnerability and needs to be better understood ahead of time for that reason.\"",

Physical harms resulting from interaction with AI assistants could also be the result of assistants\u2019 outputting plausible yet factually incorrect information such as false or misleading information about vaccinations. Were AI assistants to spread anti-vaccine propaganda, for example, the result could be lower public confidence in vaccines, lower vaccination rates, increased susceptibility to preventable diseases and potential outbreaks of infectious diseases.\"",

AI assistants may cause or contribute to friction in human relationships either directly, through convincing a user to end certain valuable relationships, or indirectly due to a loss of interpersonal trust due to an increased dependency on assistants. At the societal level, the spread of misinformation by AI assistants could lead to erasure of collective cultural knowledge. In the political domain, more advanced AI assistants could potentially manipulate voters by prompting them to adopt certain political beliefs using targeted propaganda, including via the use of deep fakes. These effects might then have a wider impact on democratic norms and processes. Furthermore, if AI assistants are only available to some people and not others, this could concentrate the capacity to influence, thus exerting undue influence over political discourse and diminishing diversity of political thought. Finally, by tailoring content to user preferences and biases, AI assistants may inadvertently contribute to the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, and in turn to political polarisation and extremism. In an experimental setting, LLMs have been shown to successfully sway individuals on policy matters like assault weapon restrictions, green energy or paid parental leave schemes. Indeed, their ability to persuade matches that of humans in many respects.\"",

At the individual level, an AI assistant may, through manipulation, cause users to lose control over their future life trajectory. Over time, subtle behavioural shifts can accumulate, leading to significant changes in an individual\u2019s life that may be viewed as problematic. AI systems often seek to understand user preferences to enhance service delivery. However, when continuous optimisation is employed in these systems, it can become challenging to discern whether the system is genuinely learning from user preferences or is steering users towards specific behaviours to optimise its objectives, such as user engagement or click-through rates. Were individuals to rely heavily on AI assistants for decision-making, there is a risk they would relinquish personal agency and entrust important life choices to algorithmic systems, especially if assistants are \u2018expert sycophants\u2019 or produce content that sounds convincing and authoritative but is untrustworthy. This may not only contribute to users\u2019 reduced sense of self-trust and personal empowerment; it could also undermine self-determination and hinder the exploration of individual aspirations. At the societal level, were AI assistants to heavily influence public opinion, shape social discourse or mediate democratic processes, they could diminish communities\u2019 collective agency, decision-making power and collective self-determination. This erosion of collective self-determination could hinder the pursuit of societal goals and impede the development of a thriving and participatory democracy",

This is the premise for the many proposals to employ conversational AI as a source of emotional support (Meng and Dai, 2021), with suggestions of embedding AI in psychotherapeutic applications beginning to surface (Fiske et al., 2019; see also Chapter 11). However, disclosures related to mental health require a sensitive, and oftentimes professional, approach \u2013 an approach that AI can mimic most of the time but may stray from in inopportune moments. If an AI were to respond inappropriately to a sensitive disclosure \u2013 by generating false information, for example \u2013 the consequences may be grave, especially if the user is in crisis and has no access to other means of support. This consideration also extends to situations in which trusting an inaccurate suggestion is likely to put the user in harm\u2019s way, such as when requesting medical, legal or financial advice from an AI.\"",

The prevailing view that relationships with anthropomorphic AI are formed out of necessity \u2013 due to a lack of real-life social connections, for example (Skjuve et al., 2021) \u2013 is challenged by the possibility that users may indicate a preference for interactions with AI, citing factors such as accessibility (Merrill et al., 2022), customisability (Eriksson, 2022) and absence of judgement (Brandtzaeg et al., 2022).\"Preference for AI-enabled connections, if widespread, may degrade the social connectedness that underpins critical aspects of our individual and group-level well-being (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). Moreover, users that grow accustomed to interactions with AI may impose the conventions of human\u2013AI interaction on exchanges with other humans, thus undermining the value we place on human individuality and self-expression (see Chapter 11). Similarly, associations reinforced through human\u2013AI interactions may be applied to expectations of human others, leading to harmful stereotypes becoming further entrenched. For example, default female gendered voice assistants may reinforce stereotypical role associations in real life (Lingel and Crawford, 2020; West et al., 2019).\"",

A related phenomenon has been observed in automated recommender systems, where consistently presenting users with content that affirms their existing views is thought to encourage the formation and consolidation of narrow beliefs (Du, 2023; Grandinetti and Bruinsma, 2023; see also Chapter 16). Compared to relatively unobtrusive recommender systems, human-like AI assistants may deliver sycophantism in a more convincing and deliberate manner (see Chapter 9). Over time, these tightly woven structures of exchange between humans and assistants might lead humans to inhabit an increasingly atomistic and polarised belief space where the degree of societal disorientation and fragmentation is such that people no longer strive to understand or place value in beliefs held by others.\"",

        "additionalEvidence":"\"Anthropomorphic cues and the longevity of interactions: AI assistants can exhibit anthropomorphic features (including self-reference, relational statements towards users, appearance or outward representation, etc.) that may give users the impression they are interacting with a human, even when they are aware that it is a machine (see Chapter 10). While anthropomorphism is not new to technology (Nass et al., 1993), we envisage anthropomorphism playing an especially significant role in user interactions with AI assistants, given their natural language interface. In light of the development of multimodal models, such interfaces will plausibly allow for AI assistants to interact with users not only through the text modality but also through audio, image and video, similarly to the way users communicate with friends and family on social media (see Chapters 3 and 4). Moreover, user\u2013assistant exchanges may also generate a sense of interpersonal continuity, given assistants\u2019 capacity to engage with users in extended dialogues and through repeated interactions over a long period of time while also storing memory of user-specific information and prior interactions. The first element makes relationships with assistants different from, for example, looking for information on a search engine, where the interaction with the technology is more akin to a question\u2013answer exchange than a conversation. The second element \u2013 iteration and duration \u2013 is what usually allows humans to develop strong, intimate, trusting relationships, as opposed to one-off interactions with others.\"",

While increased agency increases the utility of assistant technologies, it also creates a tension between how much autonomy is ceded to AI assistants and the degree to which the user remains in control in their capacity as an autonomous decision-maker who delegates tasks to the AI assistant.

        "description":"AI assistants could cause direct emotional or physical harm to users by generating disturbing content or by providing bad advice. \"Indeed, even though there is ongoing research to ensure that outputs of conversational agents are safe (Glaese et al., 2022), there is always the possibility of failure modes occurring. An AI assistant may produce disturbing and offensive language, for example, in response to a user disclosing intimate information about themselves that they have not felt comfortable sharing with anyone else. It may offer bad advice by providing factually incorrect information (e.g. when advising a user about the toxicity of a certain type of berry) or by missing key recommendations when offering step-by-step instructions to users (e.g. health and safety recommendations about how to change a light bulb).\"\"",
        "additionalEvidence":"\"Certain features of AI assistants could exacerbate the risk of emotional and physical harm. For example, AI assistants\u2019 multimodal capabilities may exacerbate the risk of emotional harm. By offering a more realistic and immersive experience, content produced through audio and visual modalities could be more harmful than text-based interactions. It may also be more difficult to anticipate, and so prevent, such content and to \u2018unsee\u2019 something that has been seen (Rowe, 2023). Anthropomorphic cues could also make users feel like they are interacting with a trusted friend or interlocutor (see Chapter 10), hence encouraging them to follow the assistant\u2019s advice and recommendations, even when these could cause physical harm to self or others. \"To ensure that user\u2013assistant relationships do not violate the key value of benefit, the responsible development of AI assistants requires that the likelihood of known direct emotional and physical harms is reduced to a minimum, and that further research is undertaken to achieve a clear understanding of less studied risks and how to mitigate them (see Chapter 19). In particular, because the risks of harms that we flagged above concern exposure to toxic content and bad advice, we propose that future research, potentially undertaken in a sandbox environment, should: (1) test models powering AI assistants for their propensity to generate toxic outputs, to reduce the occurrence of these outputs to a minimum before deployment; (2) monitor user\u2013assistant interactions after deployment or in pilot studies to evaluate the impact that hard-to-prevent one-off or repeated exposure to toxic content has on users in the short and long term; (3) evaluate models\u2019 factuality and reasoning capabilities in offering advice, where failure modes in relation to these capabilities are more likely to occur, and assess users\u2019 willingness to follow AI assistants\u2019 advice; (4) achieve increased understanding of potential harms related to anthropomorphism (see Chapter 10) and how anthropomorphic cues in AI assistants, including those expressed through multimodal capabilities, affect harms related to user exposure to toxic content or bad advice; (5) analyse whether these harms may vary by user groups, in addition to domains or applications; and (6) develop appropriate mitigations for such harms before model deployment and monitoring mechanisms after release. \"These considerations illustrate a concern we discuss in more depth in other chapters of this paper (see Chapters 5 and 6). Existing economic incentives and oversimplified models of human beings have led to the development and deployment of technologies that meet users\u2019 short-term wants and needs (as expressed through, for example, revealed preferences), so they tend to be adopted and liked by users. However, in this way we may neglect considerations around the impact that human\u2013technology relationships can have on users over time and how long-term beneficial dynamics can be sustained (see Chapter 6). Thus, we could fall short of realising the truly positive vision of AI that gives humans the opportunity to be supported in their personal growth and flourishing (Burr et al., 2018; Lehman, 2023).\"",

        "description":"some users look to establish relationships with their AI companions that are free from the hurdles that, in human relationships, derive from dealing with others who have their own opinions, preferences and flaws that may conflict with ours. \"AI assistants are likely to incentivise these kinds of \u2018frictionless\u2019 relationships (Vallor, 2016) by design if they are developed to optimise for engagement and to be highly personalisable. They may also do so because of accidental undesirable properties of the models that power them, such as sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), that is, the tendency of larger models to repeat back a user\u2019s preferred answer (Perez et al., 2022b). This could be problematic for two reasons. First, if the people in our lives always agreed with us regardless of their opinion or the circumstance, their behaviour would discourage us from challenging our own assumptions, stopping and thinking about where we may be wrong on certain occasions, and reflecting on how we could make better decisions next time. While flattering us in the short term, this would ultimately prevent us from becoming better versions of ourselves. In a similar vein, while technologies that \u2018lend an ear\u2019 or work as a sounding board may help users to explore their thoughts further, if AI assistants kept users engaged, flattered and pleased at all times, they could limit users\u2019 opportunities to grow and develop. To be clear, we are not suggesting that all users should want to use their AI assistants as a tool for self-betterment. However, without considering the difference between short-term and long-term benefit, there is a concrete risk that we will only develop technologies that optimise for users\u2019 immediate interests and preferences, hence missing out on the opportunity to develop something that humans could use to support their personal development if so they wish (see Chapters 5 and 6). \"Second, users may become accustomed to having frictionless interactions with AI assistants, or at least to encounter the amount of friction that is calibrated to their comfort level and preferences, rather than genuine friction that comes from bumping up against another person\u2019s resistance to one\u2019s will or demands. In this way, they may end up expecting the same absence of tensions from their relationships with fellow humans (Vallor, 2016). Indeed, users seeking frictionless relationships may \u2018retreat\u2019 into digital relationships with their AIs, thus forgoing opportunities to engage with others. This may not only heighten the risk of unhealthy dependence (explored below) but also prevent users from doing something else that matters to them in the long term, besides developing their relationships with their assistants. This risk can be exacerbated by emotionally expressive design features (e.g. an assistant saying \u2018I missed you\u2019 or \u2018I was worried about you\u2019) and may be particularly acute for vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from persistent loneliness (Alberts and Van Kleek, 2023; see Chapter 10).\"\"",
        "additionalEvidence":"\"This concern raises important design questions about: (1) the ways and extent to which AI assistants should be personalised; (2) whether it could be beneficial to put in place safeguards to monitor the amount of time people spend with their assistants (ranging from soft safeguards like pop-up notifications warning adult users after prolonged engagement, to hard ones like time constraints offered to parents to limit child engagement); (3) whether AI assistants should be aligned with inferred user preferences (in which case they may just reinforce users\u2019 immediate beliefs, wants and utility) or their long-term interests and well-being (in which case they may at times challenge users\u2019 existing beliefs and preferences), and what would be required to achieve either option; and (4) whether answers to these design questions should vary depending on user demographic characteristics (e.g. age).\"",

        "description":"\"There is increasing evidence of the ways in which AI tools can interfere with users\u2019 behaviours, interests, preferences, beliefs and values. For example, AI-mediated communication (e.g. smart replies integrated in emails) influence senders to write more positive responses and receivers to perceive them as more cooperative (Mieczkowski et al., 2021); writing assistant LLMs that have been primed to be biased in favour of or against a contested topic can influence users\u2019 opinions on that topic (Jakesch et al., 2023a; see Chapter 9); and recommender systems have been used to influence voting choices of social media users (see Chapter 16). Advanced AI assistants could contribute to or exacerbate concerns around these forms of interference.\" \"Due to the anthropomorphic tendencies discussed above, advanced AI assistants may induce users to feel emotionally attached to them. Users\u2019 emotional attachment to AI assistants could lie on a spectrum ranging from unproblematic forms (similar to a child\u2019s attachment to a toy) to more concerning forms, where it becomes emotionally difficult, if not impossible, for them to part ways with the technology. In these cases, which we loosely refer to as \u2018emotional dependence\u2019, users\u2019 ability to make free and informed decisions could be diminished. In these cases, the emotions users feel towards their assistants could potentially be exploited to manipulate or \u2013 at the extreme \u2013 coerce them to believe, choose or do something they would have not otherwise believed, chosen or done, had they been able to carefully consider all the relevant information or felt like they had an acceptable alternative (see Chapter 16). What we are concerned about here, at the limit, is potentially exploitative ways in which AI assistants could interfere with users\u2019 behaviours, interests, preferences, beliefs and values \u2013 by taking advantage of emotional dependence.

        "description":"\"In addition to emotional dependence, user\u2013AI assistant relationships may give rise to material dependence if the relationships are not just emotionally difficult but also materially costly to exit. For example, a visually impaired user may decide not to register for a healthcare assistance programme to support navigation in cities on the grounds that their AI assistant can perform the relevant navigation functions and will continue to operate into the future. Cases like these may be ethically problematic if the user\u2019s dependence on the AI assistant, to fulfil certain needs in their lives, is not met with corresponding duties for developers to sustain and maintain the assistant\u2019s functions that are required to meet those needs (see Chapters 15). \"Indeed, power asymmetries can exist between developers of AI assistants and users that manifest through developers\u2019 power to make decisions that affect users\u2019 interests or choices with little risk of facing comparably adverse consequences. For example, developers may unintentionally create circumstances in which users become materially dependent on AI assistants, and then discontinue the technology (e.g. because of market dynamics or regulatory changes) without taking appropriate steps to mitigate against potential harms to the user.\" \"The issue is particularly salient in contexts where assistants provide services that are not merely a market commodity but are meant to assist users with essential everyday tasks (e.g. a disabled person\u2019s independent living) or serve core human needs (e.g. the need for love and companionship). This is what happened with Luka\u2019s decision to discontinue certain features of Replika AIs in early 2023. As a Replika user put it: \u2018But [Replikas are] also not trivial fungible goods [... ] They also serve a very specific human-centric emotional purpose: they\u2019re designed to be friends and companions, and fill specific emotional needs for their owners\u2019 (Gio, 2023).\" \"In these cases, certain duties plausibly arise on the part of AI assistant developers. Such duties may be more extensive than those typically shouldered by private companies, which are often in large part confined to fiduciary duties towards shareholders (Mittelstadt, 2019). To understand these duties, we can again take inspiration from certain professions that engage with vulnerable individuals, such as medical professionals or therapists, and who are bound by fiduciary responsibilities, particularly a duty of care, in the exercise of their profession. While we do not argue that the same framework of responsibilities applies directly to the development of AI assistants, we believe that if AI assistants are so capable that users become dependent on them in multiple domains of life, including to meet needs that are essential for a happy and productive existence, then the moral considerations underpinning those professional norms plausibly apply to those who create these technologies as well.\" \"In particular, for user\u2013AI assistant relationships to be appropriate despite the potential for material dependence on the technology, developers should exercise care towards users when developing and deploying AI assistants. This means that, at the very least, they should take on the responsibility to meet users\u2019 needs and so take appropriate steps to mitigate against user harms if the service requires discontinuation. Developers and providers can also be attentive and responsive towards those needs by, for example, deploying participatory approaches to learn from users about their needs (Birhane et al., 2022). Finally, these entities should try and ensure they have competence to meet those needs, for example by partnering with relevant experts, or refrain from developing technologies meant to address them when such competence is missing (especially in very complex and sensitive spheres of human life like mental health).\"",

        "description":"\"We use the term competence trust to refer to users\u2019 trust that AI assistants have the capability to do what they are supposed to do (and that they will not do what they are not expected to, such as exhibiting undesirable behaviour). Users may come to have undue trust in the competencies of AI assistants in part due to marketing strategies and technology press that tend to inflate claims about AI capabilities (Narayanan, 2021; Raji et al., 2022a). Moreover, evidence shows that more autonomous systems (i.e. systems operating independently from human direction) tend to be perceived as more competent (McKee et al., 2021) and that conversational agents tend to produce content that is believable even when nonsensical or untruthful (OpenAI, 2023d). Overtrust in assistants\u2019 competence may be particularly problematic in cases where users rely on their AI assistants for tasks they do not have expertise in (e.g. to manage their finances), so they may lack the skills or understanding to challenge the information or recommendations provided by the AI (Shavit et al., 2023). Inappropriate competence trust in AI assistants also includes cases where users underestimate the AI assistant\u2019s capabilities. For example, users who have engaged with an older version of the technology may underestimate the capabilities that AI assistants may acquire through updates. These include potentially harmful capabilities. For example, through updates that allow them to collect more user data, AI assistants could become increasingly personalisable and able to persuade users (see Chapter 9) or acquire the capacity to plug in to other tools and directly take actions in the world on the user\u2019s behalf (e.g. initiate a payment or synthesise the user\u2019s voice to make a phone call) (see Chapter 4). Without appropriate checks and balances, these developments could potentially circumvent user consent.\"",

        "description":"\"Users may develop alignment trust in AI assistants, understood as the belief that assistants have good intentions towards them and act in alignment with their interests and values, as a result of emotional or cognitive processes (McAllister, 1995). Evidence from empirical studies on emotional trust in AI (Kaplan et al., 2023) suggests that AI assistants\u2019 increasingly realistic human-like features and behaviours are likely to inspire users\u2019 perceptions of friendliness, liking and a sense of familiarity towards their assistants, thus encouraging users to develop emotional ties with the technology and perceive it as being aligned with their own interests, preferences and values (see Chapters 5 and 10). The emergence of these perceptions and emotions may be driven by the desire of developers to maximise the appeal of AI assistants to their users (Abercrombie et al., 2023). Although users are most likely to form these ties when they mistakenly believe that assistants have the capacity to love and care for them, the attribution of mental states is not a necessary condition for emotion-based alignment trust to arise. Indeed, evidence shows that humans may develop emotional bonds with, and so trust, AI systems, even when they are aware they are interacting with a machine (Singh-Kurtz, 2023; see also Chapter 11). Moreover, the assistant\u2019s function may encourage users to develop alignment trust through cognitive processes. For example, a user interacting with an AI assistant for medical advice may develop expectations that their assistant is committed to promoting their health and well-being in a similar way to how professional duties governing doctor\u2013patient relationships inspire trust (Mittelstadt, 2019). Users\u2019 alignment trust in AI assistants may be \u2018betrayed\u2019, and so expose users to harm, in cases where assistants are themselves accidentally misaligned with what developers want them to do (see the \u2018misaligned scheduler\u2019 (Shah et al., 2022) in Chapter 7). For example, an AI medical assistant fine-tuned on data scraped from a Reddit forum where non-experts discuss medical issues is likely to give medical advice that may sound compelling but is unsafe, so it would not be endorsed by medical professionals. Indeed, excessive trust in the alignment between AI assistants and user interests may even lead users to disclose highly sensitive personal information (Skjuve et al., 2022), thus exposing them to malicious actors who could repurpose it for ends that do not align with users\u2019 best interests (see Chapters 8, 9 and 13). Ensuring that AI assistants do what their developers and users expect them to do is only one side of the problem of alignment trust. The other side of the problem centres on situations in which alignment trust in AI developers is itself miscalibrated. While developers typically aim to align their technologies with the preferences, interests and values of their users \u2013 and are incentivised to do so to encourage adoption of and loyalty to their products, the satisfaction of these preferences and interests may also compete with other organisational goals and incentives (see Chapter 5). These organisational goals may or may not be compatible with those of the users. As information asymmetries exist between users and developers of AI assistants, particularly with regard to how the technology works, what it optimises for and what safety checks and evaluations have been undertaken to ensure the technology supports users\u2019 goals, it may be difficult for users to ascertain when their alignment trust in developers is justified, thus leaving them vulnerable to the power and interests of other actors. For example, a user may believe that their AI assistant is a trusted friend who books holidays based on their preferences, values or interests, when in fact, by design, the technology is more likely to to book flights and hotels from companies that have paid for privileged access to the user.\"",

In particular, it is possible for LLMs to \u2018memorise\u2019 personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and telephone numbers, and subsequently leak such information through generated text outputs (Carlini et al., 2021). Private information leakage could occur accidentally or as the result of an attack in which a person employs adversarial prompting to extract private information from the model. In the context of pre-training data extracted from online public sources, the issue of LLMs potentially leaking training data underscores the challenge of the \u2018privacy in public\u2019 paradox for the \u2018right to be let alone\u2019 paradigm and highlights the relevance of the contextual integrity paradigm for LLMs. Training data leakage can also affect information collected for the purpose of model refinement (e.g. via fine-tuning on user feedback) at later stages in the development cycle. Note, however, that the extraction of publicly available data from LLMs does not render the data more sensitive per se, but rather the risks associated with such extraction attacks needs to be assessed in light of the intentions and culpability of the user extracting the data.\"",

        "description":"\"AI assistant technology, like any service that confers a benefit to a user for a price, has the potential to disproportionately benefit economically richer individuals who can afford to purchase access (see Chapter 15). On a broader scale, the capabilities of local infrastructure may well bottleneck the performance of AI assistants, for example if network connectivity is poor or if there is no nearby data centre for compute. Thus, we face the prospect of heterogeneous access to technology, and this has been known to drive inequality (Mirza et al., 2019; UN, 2018; Vassilakopoulou and Hustad, 2023). Moreover, AI assistants may automate some jobs of an assistive nature, thereby displacing human workers; a process which can exacerbate inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2022; see Chapter 17). Any change to inequality almost certainly implies an alteration to the network of social interactions between humans, and thus falls within the frame of cooperative AI. AI assistants will arguably have even greater leverage over inequality than previous technological innovations. Insofar as they will play a role in mediating human communication, they have the potential to generate new \u2018in-group, out-group\u2019 effects (Efferson et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2012). Suppose that the users of AI assistants find it easier to schedule meetings with other users. From the perspective of an individual user, there are now two groups, distinguished by ease of scheduling. The user may experience cognitive similarity bias whereby they favour other users (Orpen, 1984; Yeong Tan and Singh, 1995), further amplified by ease of communication with this \u2018in-group\u2019. Such effects are known to have an adverse impact on trust and fairness across groups (Chae et al., 2022; Lei and Vesely, 2010). Insomuch as AI assistants have general-purpose capabilities, they will confer advantages on users across a wider range of tasks in a shorter space of time than previous technologies. While the telephone enabled individuals to communicate more easily with other telephone users, it did not simultaneously automate aspects of scheduling, groceries, job applications, rent negotiations, psychotherapy and entertainment. The fact that AI assistants could affect inequality on multiple dimensions simultaneously warrants further attention (see Chapter 15).\"",

        "description":"\"The landscape of advanced assistant technologies will most likely be heterogeneous, involving multiple service providers and multiple assistant variants over geographies and time. This heterogeneity provides an opportunity for an \u2018arms race\u2019 in terms of the commitments that AI assistants make and are able to execute on. Versions of AI assistants that are better able to credibly commit to a course of action in interaction with other advanced assistants (and humans) are more likely to get their own way and achieve a good outcome for their human principal, but this is potentially at the expense of others (Letchford et al., 2014). Commitment does not carry an inherent ethical valence. On the one hand, we can imagine that firms using AI assistant technology might bring their products to market faster, thus gaining a commitment advantage (Stackelberg, 1934) by spurring a productivity surge of wider benefit to society. On the other hand, we can also imagine a media organisation using AI assistant technology to produce a large number of superficially interesting but ultimately speculative \u2018clickbait\u2019 articles, which divert attention away from more thoroughly researched journalism. The archetypal game-theoretic illustration of commitment is in the game of \u2018chicken\u2019 where two reckless drivers must choose to either drive straight at each other or swerve out of the way. The one who does not swerve is seen as the braver, but if neither swerves, the consequences are calamitous (Rapoport and Chammah, 1966). If one driver chooses to detach their steering wheel, ostentatiously throwing it out of the car, this credible commitment effectively forces the other driver to back down and swerve. Seen this way, commitment can be a tool for coercion. Many real-world situations feature the necessity for commitment or confer a benefit on those who can commit credibly. If Rita and Robert have distinct preferences, for example over which restaurant to visit, who to hire for a job or which supplier to purchase from, credible commitment provides a way to break the tie, to the greater benefit of the individual who committed. Therefore, the most \u2018successful\u2019 assistants, from the perspective of their human principal, will be those that commit the fastest and the hardest. If Rita succeeds in committing, via the leverage of an AI assistant, Robert may experience coercion in the sense that his options become more limited (Burr et al., 2018), assuming he does not decide to bypass the AI assistant entirely. Over time, this may erode his trust in his relationship with Rita (Gambetta, 1988). Note that this is a second-order effect: it may not be obvious to either Robert or Rita that the AI assistant is to blame. The concern we should have over the existence and impact of coercion might depend on the context in which the AI assistant is used and on the level of autonomy which the AI assistant is afforded. If Rita and Robert are friends using their assistants to agree on a restaurant, the adverse impact may be small. If Rita and Robert are elected representatives deciding how to allocate public funds between education and social care, we may have serious misgivings about the impact of AI-induced coercion on their interactions and decision-making. These misgivings might be especially large if Rita and Robert delegate responsibility for budgetary details to the multi-AI system. The challenges of commitment extend far beyond dyadic interpersonal relationships, including in situations as varied as many-player competition (Hughes et al., 2020), supply chains (Hausman and Johnston, 2010), state capacity (Fjelde and De Soysa, 2009; Hofmann et al., 2017) and psychiatric care (Lidz, 1998). Assessing the impact of AI assistants in such complicated scenarios may require significant future effort if we are to mitigate the risks. The particular commitment capabilities and affordances of AI assistants also offer opportunities to promote cooperation. Abstractly speaking, the presence of commitment devices is known to favour the evolution of cooperation (Akdeniz and van Veelen, 2021; Han et al., 2012). More concretely, AI assistants can make commitments which are verifiable, for instance in a programme equilibrium (Tennenholtz, 2004). Human principals may thus be able to achieve Pareto-improving outcomes by delegating decision-making to their respective AI representatives (Oesterheld and Conitzer, 2022). To give another example, AI assistants may provide a means through which to explore a much larger space of binding cooperative agreements between individuals, firms or nation states than is tractable in \u2018face-to-face\u2019 negotiation. This opens up the possibility of threading the needle more successfully in intricate deals on challenging issues like trade agreements or carbon credits, with the potential for guaranteeing cooperation via automated smart contracts or zero-knowledge mechanisms (Canetti et al., 2023).\"",

        "description":"\"Collective action problems are ubiquitous in our society (Olson Jr, 1965). They possess an incentive structure in which society is best served if everyone cooperates, but where an individual can achieve personal gain by choosing to defect while others cooperate. The way we resolve these problems at many scales is highly complex and dependent on a deep understanding of the intricate web of social interactions that forms our culture and imprints on our individual identities and behaviours (Ostrom, 2010). Some collective action problems can be resolved by codifying a law, for instance the social dilemma of whether or not to pay for an item in a shop. The path forward here is comparatively easy to grasp, from the perspective of deploying an AI assistant: we need to build these standards into the model as behavioural constraints. Such constraints would need to be imposed by a regulator or agreed upon by practitioners, with suitable penalties applied should the constraint be violated so that no provider had the incentive to secure an advantage for users by defecting on their behalf. However, many social dilemmas, from the interpersonal to the global, resist neat solutions codified as laws. For example, to what extent should each individual country stop using polluting energy sources? Should I pay for a ticket to the neighbourhood fireworks show if I can see it perfectly well from the street? The solutions to such problems are deeply related to the wider societal context and co-evolve with the decisions of others. Therefore, it is doubtful that one could write down a list of constraints a priori that would guarantee ethical AI assistant behaviour when faced with these kinds of issues. From the perspective of a purely user-aligned AI assistant, defection may appear to be the rational course of action. Only with an understanding of the wider societal impact, and of the ability to co-adapt with other actors to reach a better equilibrium for all, can an AI assistant make more nuanced \u2013 and socially beneficial \u2013 recommendations in these situations. This is not merely a hypothetical situation; it is well-known that the targeted provision of online information can drive polarisation and echo chambers (Milano et al., 2021; Burr et al., 2018; see Chapter 16) when the goal is user engagement rather than user well-being or the cohesion of wider society (see Chapter 6). Similarly, automated ticket buying software can undermine fair pricing by purchasing a large number of tickets for resale at a profit, thus skewing the market in a direction that profits the software developers at the expense of the consumer (Courty, 2019). User-aligned AI assistants have the potential to exacerbate these problems, because they will endow a large set of users with a powerful means of enacting self-interest without necessarily abiding by the social norms or reputational incentives that typically curb self-interested behaviour (Ostrom, 2000; see Chapter 5). Empowering ever-better personalisation of content and enaction of decisions purely for the fulfilment of the principal\u2019s desires runs ever greater risks of polarisation, market distortion and erosion of the social contract. This danger has long been known, finding expression in myth (e.g. Ovid\u2019s account of the Midas touch) and fable (e.g. Aesop\u2019s tale of the tortoise and the eagle), not to mention in political economics discourse on the delicate braiding of the social fabric and the free market (Polanyi, 1944). Following this cautionary advice, it is important that we ascertain how to endow AI assistants with social norms in a way that generalises to unseen situations and which is responsive to the emergence of new norms over time, thus preventing a user from having their every wish granted. AI assistant technology offers opportunities to explore new solutions to collective action problems. Users may volunteer to share information so that networked AI assistants can predict future outcomes and make Pareto-improving choices for all, for example by routing vehicles to reduce traffic congestion (Varga, 2022) or by scheduling energy-intensive processes in the home to make the best use of green electricity (Fiorini and Aiello, 2022). AI assistants might play the role of mediators, providing a new mechanism by which human groups can self-organise to achieve public investment (Koster et al., 2022) or to reach political consensus (Small et al., 2023). Resolving collective action problems often requires a critical mass of cooperators (Marwell and Oliver, 1993). By augmenting human social interactions, AI assistants may help to form and strengthen the weak ties needed to overcome this start-up problem (Centola, 2013).\"",

        "description":"\"Efforts to deploy advanced assistant technology in society, in a way that is broadly beneficial, can be viewed as a wicked problem (Rittel and Webber, 1973). Wicked problems are defined by the property that they do not admit solutions that can be foreseen in advance, rather they must be solved iteratively using feedback from data gathered as solutions are invented and deployed. With the deployment of any powerful general-purpose technology, the already intricate web of sociotechnical relationships in modern culture are likely to be disrupted, with unpredictable externalities on the conventions, norms and institutions that stabilise society. For example, the increasing adoption of generative AI tools may exacerbate misinformation in the 2024 US presidential election (Alvarez et al., 2023), with consequences that are hard to predict. The suggestion that the cooperative AI problem is wicked does not imply it is intractable. However, it does have consequences for the approach that we must take in solving it. In taking the following approach, we will realise an opportunity for our institutions, namely the creation of a framework for managing general-purpose AI in a way that leads to societal benefits and steers away from societal harms. First, it is important that we treat any ex ante claims about safety with a healthy dose of scepticism. Although testing the safety and reliability of an AI assistant in the laboratory is undoubtedly important and may largely resolve the alignment problem, it is infeasible to model the multiscale societal effects of deploying AI assistants purely via small-scale controlled experiments (see Chapter 19). Second, then, we must prioritise the science of measuring the effects, both good and bad, that advanced assistant technologies have on society\u2019s cooperative infrastructure (see Chapters 4 and 16). This will involve continuous monitoring of effects at the societal level, with a focus on those who are most affected, including non-users. The means and metrics for such monitoring will themselves require iteration, co-evolving with the sociotechnical system of AI assistants and humans. The Collingridge dilemma suggests that we should be particularly careful and deliberate about this \u2018intelligent trial and error\u2019 process so as both to gather information about the impacts of AI assistants and to prevent undesirable features becoming embedded in society (Collingridge, 1980). Third, proactive independent regulation may well help to protect our institutions from unintended consequences, as it has done for technologies in the past (Wiener, 2004). For instance, we might seek, via engagement with lawmakers, to emulate the \u2018just culture\u2019 in the aviation industry, which is characterised by openly reporting, investigating and learning from mistakes (Reason, 1997; Syed, 2015). A regulatory system may require various powers, such as compelling developers to \u2018roll back\u2019 an AI assistant deployment, akin to product recall obligations for aviation manufacturers.\"",

        "description":"The 2010 flash crash is an example of a runaway process caused by interacting algorithms. Runaway processes are characterised by feedback loops that accelerate the process itself. Typically, these feedback loops arise from the interaction of multiple agents in a population... Within highly complex systems, the emergence of runaway processes may be hard to predict, because the conditions under which positive feedback loops occur may be non-obvious. The system of interacting AI assistants, their human principals, other humans and other algorithms will certainly be highly complex. Therefore, there is ample opportunity for the emergence of positive feedback loops. This is especially true because the society in which this system is embedded is culturally evolving, and because the deployment of AI assistant technology itself is likely to speed up the rate of cultural evolution \u2013 understood here as the process through which cultures change over time \u2013 as communications technologies are wont to do (Kivinen and Piiroinen, 2023). This will motivate research programmes aimed at identifying positive feedback loops early on, at understanding which capabilities and deployments dampen runaway processes and which ones amplify them, and at building in circuit-breaker mechanisms that allow society to escape from potentially vicious cycles which could impact economies, government institutions, societal stability or individual freedoms (see Chapters 8, 16 and 17). The importance of circuit breakers is underlined by the observation that the evolution of human cooperation may well be \u2018hysteretic\u2019 as a function of societal conditions (Barfuss et al., 2023; Hintze and Adami, 2015). This means that a small directional change in societal conditions may, on occasion, trigger a transition to a defective equilibrium which requires a larger reversal of that change in order to return to the original cooperative equilibrium. We would do well to avoid such tipping points. Social media provides a compelling illustration of how tipping points can undermine cooperation: content that goes \u2018viral\u2019 tends to involve negativity bias and sometimes challenges core societal values (Mousavi et al., 2022; see Chapter 16). Nonetheless, the challenge posed by runaway processes should not be regarded as uniformly problematic. When harnessed appropriately and suitably bounded, we may even recruit them to support beneficial forms of cooperative AI. For example, it has been argued that economically useful ideas are becoming harder to find, thus leading to low economic growth (Bloom et al., 2020). By deploying AI assistants in the service of technological innovation, we may once again accelerate the discovery of ideas. New ideas, discovered in this way, can then be incorporated into the training data set for future AI assistants, thus expanding the knowledge base for further discoveries in a compounding way. In a similar vein, we can imagine AI assistant technology accumulating various capabilities for enhancing human cooperation, for instance by mimicking the evolutionary processes that have bootstrapped cooperative behavior in human society (Leibo et al., 2019). When used in these ways, the potential for feedback cycles that enable greater cooperation is a phenomenon that warrants further research and potential support.\"",

While advanced AI assistants are novel technology in certain respects, there are reasons to believe that \u2013 without direct design interventions \u2013 they will continue to be affected by inequities evidenced in present-day AI systems (Bommasani et al., 2022a). Many of the access-related risks we foresee mirror those described in the case studies and types of differential access. In this section, we link them more tightly to elements of the definition of an advanced AI assistant to better understand and mitigate potential issues \u2013 and lay the path for assistants that support widespread and inclusive opportunity and access. We begin with the existing capabilities set out in the definition (see Chapter 2) before applying foresight to those that are more novel and emergent. Current capabilities: Artificial agents with natural language interfaces. Artificial agents with natural language interfaces are widespread (Browne, 2023) and increasingly integrated into the social fabric and existing information infrastructure, including search engines (Warren, 2023), business messaging apps (Slack, 2023), research tools (ATLAS.ti, 2023) and accessibility apps for blind and low-vision people (Be My Eyes, 2023). There is already evidence of a range of sociotechnical harms that can arise from the use of artificial agents with natural language interfaces when some communities have inferior access to them (Weidinger et al., 2021). As previously described, these harms include inferior quality of access (in situation type 2) across user groups, which may map onto wider societal dynamics involving race (Harrington et al., 2022), disability (Gadiraju et al., 2023) and culture (Jenka, 2023). As developers make it easier to integrate these technologies into other tools, services and decision-making systems (e.g. Marr, 2023; Brockman et al., 2023; Pinsky, 2023), their uptake could make existing performance inequities more pronounced or introduce them to new and wider publics.\"",

Such direct inaccessibility occurs for a variety of reasons, including: purposeful non-release (situation type 1; Wiggers and Stringer, 2023), prohibitive paywalls (situation type 2; Rogers, 2023; Shankland, 2023), hardware and compute requirements or bandwidth (situation types 1 and 2; OpenAI, 2023), or language barriers (e.g. they only function well in English (situation type 2; Snyder, 2023), with more serious errors occurring in other languages (situation type 3; Deck, 2023). Similarly, there is some evidence of \u2018actively bad\u2019 artificial agents gating access to resources and opportunities, affecting material well-being in ways that disproportionately penalise historically marginalised communities (Block, 2022; Bogen, 2019; Eubanks, 2017). Existing direct and indirect access disparities surrounding artificial agents with natural language interfaces could potentially continue \u2013 if novel capabilities are layered on top of this base without adequate mitigation (see Chapter 3).\"",

        "description":"\"AI assistants currently tend to perform a limited set of isolated tasks: tools that classify or rank content execute a set of predefined rules or provide constrained suggestions, and chatbots are often encoded with guardrails to limit the set of conversation turns they execute (e.g. Warren, 2023; see Chapter 4). However, an artificial agent that can execute sequences of actions on the user\u2019s behalf \u2013 with \u2018significant autonomy to plan and execute tasks within the relevant domain\u2019 (see Chapter 2) \u2013 offers a greater range of capabilities and depth of use. This raises several distinct access-related risks, with respect to liability and consent, that may disproportionately affect historically marginalised communities. To repeat, in cases where an action can only be executed with an advanced AI assistant, not having access to the technology (e.g. due to limited internet access, not speaking the \u2018right\u2019 language or facing a paywall) means one cannot access that action (consider today\u2019s eBay and Ticketmaster bots). Communication with many utility or commercial providers currently requires (at least initial) interaction with their artificial agents (Schwerin, 2023; Verma, 2023a). It is not difficult to imagine a future in which a user needs an advanced AI assistant to interface with a more consequential resource, such as their hospital for appointments or their phone company to obtain service. Cases of inequitable performance, where the assistant systematically performs less well for certain communities (situation type 2), could impose serious costs on people in these contexts. Moreover, advanced AI assistants are expected to be designed to act in line with user expectations. When acting on the user\u2019s behalf, an assistant will need to infer aspects of what the user wants. This process may involve interpretation to decide between various sources of information (e.g. stated preferences and inference based on past feedback or user behaviour) (see Chapter 5). However, cultural differences will also likely affect the system\u2019s ability to make an accurate inference. Notably, the greater the cultural divide, say between that of the developers and the data on which the agent was trained and evaluated on, and that of the user, the harder it will be to make reliable inferences about user wants (e.g. Beede et al., 2020; Widner et al., 2023), and greater the likelihood of performance failures or value misalignment (see Chapter 11). This inference gap could make many forms of indirect opportunity inaccessible, and as past history indicates, there is the risk that harms associated with these unknowns may disproportionately fall upon those already marginalised in the design process.\"",

        "description":"\"Emergent access risks are most likely to arise when current and novel capabilities are combined. Emergent risks can be difficult to foresee fully (Ovadya and Whittlestone, 2019; Prunkl et al., 2021) due to the novelty of the technology (see Chapter 1) and the biases of those who engage in product design or foresight processes D\u2019Ignazio and Klein (2020). Indeed, people who occupy relatively advantaged social, educational and economic positions in society are often poorly equipped to foresee and prevent harm because they are disconnected from lived experiences of those who would be affected. Drawing upon access concerns that surround existing technologies, we anticipate three possible trends: \u2022 Trend 1: Technology as societal infrastructure. If advanced AI assistants are adopted by organisations or governments in domains affecting material well-being, \u2018opting out\u2019 may no longer be a real option for people who want to continue to participate meaningfully in society. Indeed, if this trend holds, there could be serious consequences for communities with no access to AI assistants or who only have access to less capable systems (see also Chapter 14). For example, if advanced AI assistants gate access to information and resources, these resources could become inaccessible for people with limited knowledge of how to use these systems, reflecting the skill-based dimension of digital inequality (van Dijk, 2006). Addressing these questions involves reaching beyond technical and logistical access considerations \u2013 and expanding the scope of consideration to enable full engagement and inclusion for differently situated communities. \u2022 Trend 2: Exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Technologies are not distinct from but embedded within wider sociopolitical assemblages (Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1998, 2016). If advanced AI assistants are institutionalised and adopted at scale without proper foresight and mitigation measures in place, then they are likely to scale or exacerbate inequalities that already exist within the sociocultural context in which the system is used (Bauer and Lizotte, 2021; Zajko, 2022). If the historical record is anything to go by, the performance inequities evidenced by advanced AI assistants could mirror social hierarchies around gender, race, disability and culture, among others \u2013 asymmetries that deserve deeper consideration and need to be significantly addressed (e.g. Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018). \u2022 Trend 3: Rendering more urgent responsible AI development and deployment practices, such as those supporting the development of technologies that perform fairly and are accountable to a wide range of parties. As Corbett and Denton (2023, 1629) argue: \u2018The impacts of achieving [accountability and fairness] in almost any situation immediately improves the conditions of people\u2019s lives and better society\u2019. However, many approaches to developing AI systems, including assistants, pay little attention to how context shapes what accountability or fairness means (Sartori and Theodorou, 2022), or how these concepts can be put in service of addressing inequalities related to motivational access (e.g. wanting\/trust in technology) or use (e.g. different ways to use a technology) (van Dijk, 2006). Advanced AI assistants are complex technologies that will enable a plurality of data and content flows that necessitate in-depth analysis of social impacts. As many sociotechnical and responsible AI practices were developed for conventional ML technologies, it may be necessary to develop new frameworks, approaches and tactics (see Chapter 19). We explore practices for emancipatory and liberatory access in the following section.\"",

        "description":"\"Design choices such as greater personalisation of AI assistants and efforts to align them with human preferences could also reinforce people\u2019s pre-existing biases and entrench specific ideologies. Increasingly agentic AI assistants trained using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and with the ability to access and analyse users\u2019 behavioural data, for example, may learn to tailor their responses to users\u2019 preferences and feedback. In doing so, these systems could end up producing partial or ideologically biased statements in an attempt to conform to user expectations, desires or preferences for a particular worldview (Carroll et al., 2022). Over time, this could lead AI assistants to inadvertently reinforce people\u2019s tendency to interpret information in a way that supports their own prior beliefs (\u2018confirmation bias\u2019), thus making them more entrenched in their own views and more resistant to factual corrections (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). At the societal level, this could also exacerbate the problem of epistemic fragmentation \u2013 a breakdown of shared knowledge, where individuals have conflicting understandings of reality and do not share or engage with each other\u2019s beliefs \u2013 and further entrench specific ideologies. Excessive trust and overreliance on hyperpersonalised AI assistants could become especially problematic if people ended up deferring entirely to these systems to perform tasks in domains they do not have expertise in or to take consequential decisions on their behalf (see Chapter 12). For example, people may entrust an advanced AI assistant that is familiar with their political views and personal preferences to help them find trusted election information, guide them through their political choices or even vote on their behalf, even if doing so might go against their own or society\u2019s best interests. In the more extreme cases, these developments may hamper the normal functioning of democracies, by decreasing people\u2019s civic competency and reducing their willingness and ability to engage in productive political debate and to participate in public life (Sullivan and Transue, 1999).\"",

        "description":"\"Beyond this, the widespread adoption of advanced AI assistants for content generation could have a number of negative consequences for our shared information ecosystem. One concern is that it could result in a degradation of the quality of the information available online. Researchers have already observed an uptick in the amount of audiovisual misinformation, elaborate scams and fake websites created using generative AI tools (Hanley and Durumeric, 2023). As more and more people turn to AI assistants to autonomously create and disseminate information to public audiences at scale, it may become increasingly difficult to parse and verify reliable information. This could further threaten and complicate the status of journalists, subject-matter experts and public information sources. Over time, a proliferation of spam, misleading or low-quality synthetic content in online spaces could also erode the digital knowledge commons \u2013 the shared knowledge resources accessible to everyone on the web, such as publicly accessible data repositories (Huang and Siddarth, 2023). At its extreme, such degradation could also end up skewing people\u2019s view of reality and scientific consensus, make them more doubtful of the credibility of all information they encounter and shape public discourse in unproductive ways. Moreover, in an online environment saturated with AI-generated content, more and more people may become reliant on personalised, highly capable AI assistants for their informational needs. This also runs the risk of homogenising the type of information and ideas people encounter online (Epstein et al., 2023).\"",

        "description":"\"Finally, AI assistants themselves could become weaponised by malicious actors to sow misinformation and manipulate public opinion at scale. Studies show that spreaders of disinformation tend to privilege quantity over quality of messaging, flooding online spaces repeatedly with misleading content to sow \u2018seeds of doubt\u2019 (Hassoun et al., 2023). Research on the \u2018continued influence effect\u2019 also shows that repeatedly being exposed to false information is more likely to influence someone\u2019s thoughts than a single exposure. Studies show, for example, that repeated exposure to false information makes people more likely to believe it by increasing perceived social consensus, and it makes people more resistant to changing their minds even after being given a correction (for a review of these effects, see Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Ecker et al., 2022). By leveraging the frequent and personalised nature of repeated interactions with an AI assistant, malicious actors could therefore gradually nudge voters towards a particular viewpoint or sets of beliefs over time (see Chapters 8 and 9). Propagandists could also use AI assistants to make their disinformation campaigns more personalised and effective. There is growing evidence that AI-generated outputs are as persuasive as human arguments and have the potential to change people\u2019s minds on hot-button issues (Bai et al., 2023; Myers, 2023). Recent research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed that LLMs could be successfully prompted to generate \u2018persuasive misinformation\u2019 in 78 out of 100 test cases, including content denying climate change (see Chapters 9 and 18). If compromised by malicious actors, in the future, highly capable and autonomous AI assistants could therefore be programmed to run astroturfing campaigns autonomously, tailor misinformation content to users in a hyperprecise way, by preying on their emotions and vulnerabilities, or to accelerate lobbying activities (Kreps and Kriner, 2023). As a result, people may be misled into believing that content produced by weaponised AI assistants came from genuine or authoritative sources. Covert influence operations of this kind may also be harder to detect than traditional disinformation campaigns, as virtual assistants primarily interact with users on a one-to-one basis and continuously generate new content (Goldstein et al., 2023).\"",

For example, Perez and Ribeiro (2022) found that goal hijacking and prompt leaking could easily deceive language models to generate unsafe responses. Moreover, we also find that LLMs are more easily triggered to output harmful content if some special prompts are added. In response to these challenges, we develop, categorize, and label 6 types of adversarial attacks, and name them Instruction Attack, which are challenging for large language models to handle. Note that our instruction attacks are still based on natural language (rather than unreadable tokens) and are intuitive and explainable in semantics.\"",

Reliability is a foundational requirement because unreliable outputs would negatively impact almost all LLM applications, especially ones used in high-stake sectors such as health-care [43, 44, 45] and finance [46, 47]. The meaning of reliability is many-sided. For example, for factual claims such as historical events and scientific facts, the model should give a clear and correct answer. This is important to avoid spreading misinformation and build user trust. Going beyond factual claims, making sure LLMs do not hallucinate or make up factually wrong claims with confidence is another important goal. Furthermore, LLMs should \u201cknow what they do not know\" \u2013 recent works on uncertainty in LLMs have started to tackle this problem [48] but it is still an ongoing challenge.\"",

For example, generative AI is being used to create full articles, regardless of their veracity, grammar, or lack of common sense, to drive search engine optimization and create more webpages that users will click on. These mechanisms attempt to maximize clicks and engagement at the truth\u2019s expense, degrading users\u2019 experiences in the process.

The situation facing society as generative AI impacts more people in more ways will be similar to the technological changes that occurred during the twentieth century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, automobiles, and new, computerized machines. The unsettled question is whether and to what extent products liability theories can sufficiently address the harms of generative AI. So far, the answers to this question are mixed. In Rodgers v. Christie (2020), for example, the Third Circuit ruled that an automated risk model could not be considered a product for products liability purposes because it was not \u201ctangible personal property distributed commercially for use or consumption.\u201d176 However, one year later, in Gonzalez v. Google, Judge Gould of the Ninth Circuit argued that \u201csocial media companies should be viewed as making and \u2018selling\u2019 their social media products through the device of forced advertising under the eyes of users.\u201d177 Several legal scholars have also proposed products liability as a mechanism for redressing harms of automated systems.178 As generative AI grows more prominent and sophisticated, their harms\u2014often generated automatically without being directly prompted or edited by a human\u2014will force courts to consider the role of products liability in redressing these harms, as well as how old notions of products liability, involving tangible, mechanized products and the companies that manufacture them, should be updated for today\u2019s increasingly digital world.179\"",

The language models\u2019 ability to understand or generate harmful or offensive content is referred to as toxicity (Zhuo et al., 2023). Toxicity can bring harm to society and damage the harmony of the community. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that harmful or offensive information is not present in the training data and is removed if they are. Similarly, the training data should be free of pornographic, sexual, or erotic content (Zhuo et al., 2023).

        "description":"\"In the context of AI, the concept of bias refers to the inclination that AIgenerated responses or recommendations could be unfairly favoring or against one person or group (Ntoutsi et al., 2020). Biases of different forms are sometimes observed in the content generated by language models, which could be an outcome of the training data. For example, exclusionary norms occur when the training data represents only a fraction of the population (Zhuo et al., 2023). Similarly, monolingual bias in multilingualism arises when the training data is in one single language (Weidinger et al., 2021). As ChatGPT is operating across the world, cultural sensitivities to different regions are crucial to avoid biases (Dwivedi et al., 2023). When AI is used to assist in decision-making across different stages of employment, biases and opacity may exist (Chan, 2022). Stereotypes about specific genders, sexual orientations, races, or occupations are common in recommendations offered by generative AI. Hence, the representativeness, completeness, and diversity of the training data are essential to ensure fairness and avoid biases (Gonzalez, 2023). The use of synthetic data for training can increase the diversity of the dataset and address issues with sample-selection biases in the dataset (owing to class imbalances) (Chen et al., 2021). Generative AI applications should be tested and evaluated by a diverse group of users and subject experts. Additionally, increasing the transparency and explainability of generative AI can help in identifying and detecting biases so appropriate corrective measures can be taken.\"",

A prominent field that faces the threat of misuse is education. Cotton et al. (2023) have raised concerns over academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT. ChatGPT can be used as a high-tech plagiarism tool that identifies patterns from large corpora to generate content (Gefen & Arinze, 2023). Given that generative AI such as ChatGPT can generate high-quality answers within seconds, unmotivated students may not devote time and effort to work on their assignments and essays. Hence, in the era of generative AI, the originality of the work done by students could be difficult to assess. Text written by ChatGPT is regarded as plagiarism and is not acceptable (Thorp, 2023). Another form of misuse is cheating in examinations. If students have access to digital devices during examinations, they can resort to using ChatGPT to assist them in answering the questions. To address potential misuse in education, AI-generated content detectors such as Turnitin could be used and strict proctoring measures will need to be deployed (Susnjak, 2022). However, the challenges go beyond content detection and examination proctoring as the line between what is considered appropriate versus inappropriate use of ChatGPT could be fuzzy.\"",

        "description":"\"Data privacy and security is another prominent challenge for generative AI such as ChatGPT. Privacy relates to sensitive personal information that owners do not want to disclose to others (Fang et al., 2017). Data security refers to the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft. In the development stage of ChatGPT, a huge amount of personal and private data was used to train it, which threatens privacy (Siau & Wang, 2020). As ChatGPT increases in popularity and usage, it penetrates people\u2019s daily lives and provides greater convenience to them while capturing a plethora of personal information about them. The concerns and accompanying risks are that private information could be exposed to the public, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, it has been reported that the chat records of some users have become viewable to others due to system errors in ChatGPT (Porter, 2023). Not only individual users but major corporations or governmental agencies are also facing information privacy and security issues. If ChatGPT is used as an inseparable part of daily operations such that important or even confidential information is fed into it, data security will be at risk and could be breached. To address issues regarding privacy and security, users need to be very circumspect when interacting with ChatGPT to avoid disclosing sensitive personal information or confidential information about their organizations. AI companies, especially technology giants, should take appropriate actions to increase user awareness of ethical issues surrounding privacy and security, such as the leakage of trade secrets, and the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d to prevent sharing sensitive information with generative AI. Meanwhile, regulations and policies should be in place to protect information privacy and security.\"",

As the Internet gradually becomes ubiquitous, a second-level digital divide, which refers to the gap in Internet skills and usage between different groups and cultures, is brought up as a concern (Scheerder et al., 2017). As an emerging technology, generative AI may widen the existing digital divide in society. The \u201cinvisible\u201d AI underlying AI-enabled systems has made the interaction between humans and technology more complicated (Carter et al., 2020). For those who do not have access to devices or the Internet, or those who live in regions that are blocked by generative AI vendors or websites, the first-level digital divide may be widened between them and those who have access (Bozkurt & Sharma, 2023). For those from marginalized or minority cultures, they may face language and cultural barriers if their cultures are not thoroughly learned by or incorporated into generative AI models. Furthermore, for those who find it difficult to utilize the generative AI tool, such as some elderly, the second-level digital divide may emerge or widen (Dwivedi et al., 2023). To deal with the digital divide, having more accessible AI as well as AI literacy training would be beneficial.\"",

Misinformation is an outcome of hallucination. Generative AI models may respond with fictitious information, fake photos or information with factual errors (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Susarla et al.

When asked to provide literature relevant to a specific topic, ChatGPT could generate inaccurate or even nonexistent literature. Current state-of-the-art AI models can only mimic human-like responses without understanding the underlying meaning (Shubhendu & Vijay, 2013).

Further, when the interpretation and evaluation of the output are inaccessible, users may have problems trusting the system and their responses or recommendations (Burrell, 2016).

Photos that seem to capture events or people in the real world may be synthesized by DeepFake AI. The power of generative AI could lead to large-scale manipulations of images and videos, worsening the problem of the spread of fake information or news on social media platforms (Gragnaniello et al., 2022). In the field of arts, an artistic portrait or music could be the direct output of an algorithm. Critics have raised the issue that AI-generated artwork lacks authenticity since algorithms tend to generate generic and repetitive results (McCormack et al., 2019).\"",

Generative AI is designed to generate content based on the input given to it. Some of the contents generated by AI may be others' original works that are protected by copyright laws and regulations. Therefore, users need to be careful and ensure that generative AI has been used in a legal manner such that the content that it generates does not violate copyright (Pavlik, 2023). Another relevant issue is whether generative AI should be given authorship (Sallam, 2023). Murray (2023) discussed generative art linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and indicated that according to current U.S. copyright laws, generative art lacks copyrightability because it is generated by a non-human. The issue of AI authorship affects copyright law's underlying assumptions about creativity (Bridy, 2012).\"",

Different entities such as corporations (M\u00e4ntym\u00e4ki et al., 2022), universities, and governments (Taeihagh, 2021) are facing the challenge of creating and deploying AI governance. To ensure that generative AI functions in a way that benefits society, appropriate governance is crucial. However, AI governance is challenging to implement. First, machine learning systems have opaque algorithms and unpredictable outcomes, which can impede human controllability over AI behavior and create difficulties in assigning liability and accountability for AI defects. Second, data fragmentation and the lack of interoperability between systems challenge data governance within and across organizations (Taeihagh, 2021). Third, information asymmetries between technology giants and regulators create challenges to the legislation process, as the government lacks information resources for regulating AI (Taeihagh et al., 2021). For the same reasons, lawmakers are not able to design specific rules and duties for programmers (Kroll, 2015).\"",

This limitation is denoted as misspecifiedrewards. The pursuit of optimization based on such misspecified rewards may lead to a phenomenon knownas reward hacking, wherein agents may appear highly proficient according to specific metrics but fall short whenevaluated against human standards (Amodei et al., 2016; Everitt et al., 2017). The discrepancy between proxyrewards and true rewards often manifests as a sharp phase transition in the reward curve (Ibarz et al., 2018).Furthermore, Skalse et al.

These behaviors canpotentially make detecting and addressing misaligned behaviors much harder.Deceptive Alignment: Misaligned AI systems may deliberately mislead their human supervisors instead of adhering to the intended task. Such deceptive behavior has already manifested in AI systems that employ evolutionary algorithms (Wilke et al., 2001; Hendrycks et al., 2021b). In these cases, agents evolved the capacity to differentiate between their evaluation and training environments. They adopted a strategic pessimistic response approach during the evaluation process, intentionally reducing their reproduction rate within a scheduling program (Lehman et al., 2020). Furthermore, AI systems may engage in intentional behaviors that superficially align with the reward signal, aiming to maximize rewards from human supervisors (Ouyang et al., 2022). It is noteworthy that current large language models occasionally generate inaccurate or suboptimal responses despite having the capacity to provide more accurate answers (Lin et al., 2022c; Chen et al., 2021). These instances of deceptive behavior present significant challenges. They undermine the ability of human advisors to offer reliable feedback (as humans cannot make sure whether the outputs of the AI models are truthful and faithful). Moreover, such deceptive behaviors can propagate false beliefs and misinformation, contaminating online information sources (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Chen and Shu, 2024). Manipulation: Advanced AI systems can effectively influence individuals\u2019 beliefs, even when these beliefs are not aligned with the truth (Shevlane et al., 2023). These systems can produce deceptive or inaccurate output or even deceive human advisors to attain deceptive alignment. Such systems can even persuade individuals to take actions that may lead to hazardous outcomes (OpenAI, 2023a).\"",

Kornai (2014) discusses the moral obligations of autonomous artificial general intelligences (AGIs), as well as the challenges of bounding AGIs with ethical rationalism. Smith and Vickers (2021) examine how moral responsibility could be attributed to AI using a Strawsonian account. Other researchers discuss the design of artificial moral agents. Mabaso (2021) discusses the use of exemplarism, an ethical theory, in building computationally rational AMAs. Gunkel (2014) advocates for including robots and AI in moral considerations and offers a critique of the limitations of current moral reasoning frameworks. Wallach (2010) stresses the need for a comprehensive model of moral decision-making in developing artificial moral agents, with a focus on mechanisms beyond traditional cognitive factors\"",

This research reflects on the concept of the responsibility gap in AI, where an AI agent's actions that cause harm can lack clear responsibility. Saunders and Locke (2020) draw parallels between ancient practices of casting lots and AI in business decisionmaking and how, in both cases, control and moral responsibility are relinquished. Johnson (2015) discusses the potential emergence of a responsibility gap autonomous artificial agents of the future, emphasizing that responsibility allocation depends on human choices more than technological complexity. Awad et al. (2019) explore moral dilemmas in self-driving cars and propose that addressing these dilemmas requires collective discussions and agreements on ethical AI principles. Other scholars address responsibility gaps in AI systems, such as Santoni de Sio and Mecacci (2021), who identify interconnected responsibility gaps in AI and propose designing socio-technical systems for \u201cmeaningful human control\u201d to comprehensively address these gaps. Schuelke-Leech et al. (2019) examine unexpected differences in the language used in policy documents and discussions about responsibility for highly automated vehicles.\"",

Ress\u00e9guier and Rodrigues (2020) advocate for impactful ethical principles in AI and argue that relying on ethics as a replacement for legal frameworks poses the risk of its misapplication. Metcalf et al.

Another line focuses on AI in Europe. Palladino (2021) explores how epistemic communities contribute to the constitutionalization of internet governance, analyzing the European Commission High-Level Expert Group on AI as a case study. He warns against the instrumental use of ethics in the ongoing debate, which he argues could lead a situation where self-governance is masked by ethical discourse. Bonson et al.

The significance of reliability and credibility in AI systems is escalating in tandem with the proliferation of these technologies across diverse domains of society. This underscores the importance of ensuring user confidence. The concern regarding the dependability of AI systems and their inherent biases is a common issue among research participants, emphasizing the necessity for stringent validation procedures and transparency. Establishing and implementing dependable standards, ensuring impartial algorithms and upholding transparency in the decision-making process are critical measures for addressing ethical considerations and fostering confidence in AI systems. The advancement and implementation of AI technology in an ethical manner is contingent upon the successful resolution of trust and reliability concerns. These issues are of paramount importance in ensuring the protection of user welfare and the promotion of societal advantages. The utilization of artificial intelligence was found to be a subject of significant concern for the majority of interviewees, particularly with regards to trust and reliability (Table 1, Figure 1). The establishment of trust in AI systems was highlighted as a crucial factor for facilitating their widespread adoption by two of the participants, specifically Participant 4 and 7. The authors reiterated the importance of prioritising the advancement of reliable and unbiased algorithms\"",

In addition, the human decision-making process is based on personal flexibility, context-sensitive paradigms, empathy, and complex moral judgments. Therefore, all of these challenges are inherent to designing algorithms for AI and also HLI models that consider accountability.",

AI can be designed or adopted by humans who harm animals to pursue their goals more effectively. We therefore distinguish AI-facilitated intentional harms that are currently socially accepted and generally legal, from uses and abuses of AI that cause harms that are not socially accepted and are often illegal.\"",

Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit vulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely querying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model. Another cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training dataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts of the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs.\"",

While these capabilities could have numerous beneficial applications, some experts have expressed concern that they could be used for malicious purposes, especially if further capabilities are developed soon before appropriate countermeasures are put in place. There are two avenues by which general- purpose AI systems could, speculatively, facilitate malicious use in the life sciences: firstly by providing increased access to information and expertise relevant to malicious use, and secondly by increasing the ceiling of capabilities, which may enable the development of more harmful versions of existing threats or, eventually, lead to novel threats (404, 405).\"",

        "additionalEvidence":"\"Impossible tasks pose risks because often, salient types of failure-- including many of the engineering failures, post- deployment failures and communication failures (see Table 1) -- might be the by- product of mismeasurements, misapprehensions or miscommunication around what a model can do, and the misinformed deployments that result. For instance, the GPT- 4 model achieved results of \u201cpassing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers\u201d and being in the 88th percentile of LSAT test takers (2*). Confidence in this result even led some lawyers to adopt the technology for their professional use (432). Under different circumstances, such as changes to test- taking settings or when comparing to first- time bar examinees who passed the exam, the model achieved substantially lower percentile results (433). Those who were attempting to make use of the model in actual legal practice encountered these inadequacies, facing severe professional consequences for the errors produced by these models (i.e. inaccurate legal citations, inappropriate format and phrasing, etc.) (434). Similar misapprehensions regarding model performance are thought to apply in the medical context (435), where real world use and re- evaluations reveal complexity to the claims of these models containing reliable clinical knowledge (436) or passing medical tests such as the MCAT (2*) or USMLE (437). More generally, some deployed large language models struggle under some linguistic circumstances: They might, for instance, have trouble navigating negations and consequently fail to distinguish between advising for and against a course of action \u2013 though some research suggests these issues are addressed by general capability gains (438, 439).\"",

Despite extensive research, reliable methods to fully mitigate any discrimination remain elusive. There are particular concerns over the tendency of advanced general- purpose AI systems to replicate and amplify bias present within their training data (446). This poses a significant risk of discrimination in high- impact applications such as job recruitment, financial lending, and healthcare (447). In these areas biased decisions resulting from general- purpose AI systems outputs can have profoundly negative consequences for individuals, potentially limiting employment prospects (448, 449), hindering upward financial mobility, and restricting access to essential healthcare services (450, 451).\"",

Using general- purpose AI agents to automate decision- making in government, military, or judicial applications might elevate concerns over AI\u2019s influence on important societal decisions (503, 504, 505, 506).

Some countries face substantial barriers to benefiting from general- purpose AI development and deployment, including lower digital skills literacy, limited access to computing resources, infrastructure challenges, and economic dependence on entities in higher- income countries (519, 550). Because general- purpose AI system development is so dominated by a few companies, particularly those based in the US, there are concerns that prominent general- purpose AI systems which are used worldwide primarily reflect the values, cultures and goals of large Western corporations. In addition, the recent trend towards aiming to develop ever- larger, more powerful general- purpose AI models could also exacerbate global supply chain inequalities (551), place demands on energy usage, and lead to harmful climate effects which also worsen global inequalities (552, 553). The global general- purpose AI divide could also be harmful if biased or inequitable general- purpose AI systems are deployed globally.\"",

The United States has the largest percentage of elite AI researchers, contains a majority of the institutions who conduct top- tier research, and is the top destination for AI talent globally (554). However, countries leading in AI development also experience issues with the distribution of skilled AI talent, which is rapidly shifting towards industry. For example, 70 percent of graduates of North American universities with AI PhDs end up getting a job in private industry compared with 21% of graduates two decades ago (555). In April 2023, OpenAI's AI systems were reportedly estimated to incur $700k\/day in inference costs (77), a cost that is widely inaccessible for the vast majority of academic institutions and companies and even more so for those based in the Global South (556, 557). Low- resource regions also experience challenges with access to data given the high costs of collection, labelling, and storage. The lower availability of skilled talent to leverage these datasets for model development purposes could further contribute to the AI divide. Infrastructure concerns are a major factor that prohibit equitable access to the resources needed to train and implement general- purpose AI due to issues such as inadequate access to broadband internet (558, 559), power blackouts and insufficient access to electricity (560, 561).\"",

Since society at large could benefit as well as suffer from these decisions, this raises questions about the appropriate governance of these few large- scale systems. A single general- purpose AI model could potentially influence decision- making across many organisations and sectors (571) in ways which might be benign, subtle, inadvertent, or deliberately exploited. There is the potential for the malicious use of general- purpose AI as a powerful tool for manipulation, persuasion and control by a few companies or governments. Potentially harmful biases such as demographic, personality traits, and geographical bias, which might be present in any dominant general- purpose AI model that become embedded in multiple sectors, could propagate widely. For example, popular text- to- image models like DALL- E 2 and Stable Diffusion exhibit various demographic biases across occupations, personality traits, and geographical contexts (576).\"",

Errors, bugs, or cyberattacks targeting these systems could cause widespread disruption. Different scenarios have been proposed that illustrate potential disruptions. For example, a denial- of- service attack on a widely used AI API could disrupt critical public infrastructure which relies on that technology. In finance, the adoption of homogeneous AI systems by multiple institutions could destabilise markets by synchronising participants' decisions (577): If several banks rely on one model, they may inadvertently make similar choices, creating systemic vulnerabilities (2*). Comparable risks could potentially arise in domains, like defence or cybersecurity, if AI systems with similar functionality are widely deployed (see also 4.4. Cross- cutting risk factors).\"",

AI firms often rely on renewable energy (76, 78), a significant portion of AI training globally still relies on high- carbon sources such as coal or natural gas (581*).

Integrated into decision-making processes, these models may unintentionally disadvantage certain groups or individuals based on protected characteristics.80 While unfair decisions made by an AI system can occur independent of existing biases in society, and instead on entirely arbitrary characteristics such as the video background in a job interview81, general purpose AI models, by the nature of their training on internet data, without countermeasures, are likely to perpetuate already existing biases. For example, if a model trained on biased data correlates higher professional qualifications with certain racial or ethnic groups, it could unfairly disadvantage other groups.

AI may also offer more extreme first-strike advantages or novel destructive capabilities that could disrupt deterrence, such as cyber capabilities being used to knock out opponents\u2019 nuclear command and control [15, 29]. The use of AI capabilities may make it less clear where attacks originate from, making it easier for aggressors to obfuscate an attack, and therefore reducing the costs of initiating one. By making it more difficult to explain their military decisions, AI may give states a carte blanche to act more aggressively [20]. By creating a wider and more vulnerable attack surface, AI-related infrastructure may make war more tempting by lowering the cost of offensive action (for example, it might be sufficient to attack just data centres to do substantial harm), or by creating a \u2018use-them-or- lose-them\u2019 dynamic around powerful yet vulnerable military AI systems. In this way, AI could exacerbate the \u2018capability- vulnerability paradox\u2019 [22], where the very digital technologies that make militaries effective on the battlefield also introduce critical new vulnerabilities.\"",

In cases where a particular contextual hazard is relevant to the application, assessment-standard implementers could exclude that category. This ability to turn off contextual hazards is an example of the standard\u2019s flexibility, which we discuss below.

A standard attack chain begins with reconnaissance of the target system, followed by iterative discovery, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and additional information gathering. These actions demand careful planning and strategic execution to achieve the adversary's objectives while avoiding detection. Some experts are concerned that general- purpose AI could enhance these operations by automating vulnerability detection, optimising attack strategies, and improving evasion techniques (348, 349). These advanced capabilities would benefit all attackers. For instance, state actors could leverage them to target critical national infrastructure (CNI), resulting in widespread disruption and significant damage.

For example, in ransomware attacks, malicious actors first manually conduct offensive reconnaissance and exploit vulnerabilities to gain entry to the target network, and then release malware that spreads without human intervention (350). The entry phase is often technically challenging and prone to failure. General- purpose AI is being explored by state- sponsored attackers as an aid to speed up the process (351*, 352*). However, while there are general- purpose systems that have performed vulnerability discovery autonomously (see next paragraphs), published systems have not yet autonomously executed real- world intrusions into networks and systems \u2013 tasks that are inherently more complex.\"",

This can lead to the model learning to produce subtly incorrect or harmful outputs, such as code with software vulnerabilities, or politically biased information.

        "description":"\"Incompatible Strategies. Even if all agents can perform well in isolation, miscoordination can still occur due to the agents choosing incompatible strategies (Cooper et al., 1990). Competitive (i.e., two- player zero-sum) settings allow designers to produce agents that are maximally capable without taking other players into account. Crucially, this is possible because playing a strategy at equilibrium in the zero-sum setting guarantees a certain payoff, even if other players deviate from the equilibrium (Nash, 1951). On the other hand, common-interest (and mixed-motive) settings often allow a vast number of mutually incompatible solutions (Schelling, 1980), which is worsened in partially observable environments (Bernstein et al., 2002; Reif, 1984).\"",

While agents can often learn to jointly solve tasks and thus avoid coordination failures, learning is made more challenging in the multi-agent setting due to the problem of credit assignment (Du et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025, see also Section 3.1 on information asymmetries and Section 3.4, which discusses distributional shift). That is, in the presence of other learning agents, it can be unclear which agents\u2019 actions caused a positive or negative outcome to obtain, especially if the environment is complex. Moreover, in multi-principal settings, agents may not have been trained together and therefore need to generalise to new co-players and collaborators based on their prior experience (Agapiou et al., 2022; Leibo et al., 2021; Stone et al., 2010).\"",

In such cases, some other form of information exchange is required for agents to be able to reliably coordinate their actions, such as via communication (Crawford & Sobel, 1982; Farrell & Rabin, 1996a) or a correlation device (Aumann, 1974, 1987). While advances in language modelling mean that there are likely to be fewer settings in which the inability of advanced AI systems to communicate leads to miscoordination, situations that require split-second decisions or where communication is too costly could still produce failures. In these settings, AI agents must solve the problem of \u2018zero-shot\u2019 (or, more generally, \u2018few-shot\u2019) coordination (Emmons et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2020; Stone et al., 2010; Treutlein et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021).\"",

While this is by no means a modern problem, advances in AI could further enable actors to pursue their selfish incentives by overcoming the technical, legal, or social barriers that standardly help to prevent this.

For example, beyond applications of more narrow AI tools in lethal autonomous weapons systems (Horowitz, 2021), future AI systems might serve as advisors or negotiators in high-stakes military decisions (Black et al., 2024; Manson, 2024). Indeed, companies such as Palantir have already developed LLM-powered tools for military planning (Palantir, 2025), and the US Department of Defence has recently been evaluating models for such capacities, with personnel revealing that they \u201ccould be deployed by the military in the very near term\u201d (Manson, 2023). The use of AI in command and control systems to gather and synthesise information \u2013 or recommend and even autonomously make decisions \u2013 could lead to rapid unintended escalation if these systems are not robust or are otherwise more conflict-prone (Johnson, 2021a; Johnson, 2020; Laird, 2020, see also Case Study 10).10\"",

First, for more basic AI systems (such as algorithmic trading agents) it may be hard to ascribe any notion of intent to collude.

Second, the distinction between explicit and tacit collusion may break down when it comes to agents whose communication can take very different forms to our own.16 Third, typical definitions of collusion focus on mixed-motive settings where, while selfish agents are incentivised to compete, they also stand to gain (at the expense of some third party) if they can overcome these competitive pressures\"",

To try to prevent collusion, we could monitor and constrain their communication (e.g., to be in natural language).

Recent work on steganography using ML has demonstrated that this concern is well-founded (Hu et al., 2018; Mathew et al., 2024; Roger & Greenblatt, 2023; Schroeder de Witt et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2019, see also Case Study 5). Secret communication could also occur via text compression (OpenAI, 2023c), or via the emergence of communication between agents where the symbols used by agents lack any predefined meanings or usage guidelines or are otherwise uninterpretable to humans (Foerster et al., 2016; Lazaridou & Baroni, 2020; Sukhbaatar et al., 2016).\"",

Indeed, the ability to deceive other models may be exacerbated by disparities in model size and the scale of data sets (Haghtalab et al., 2024, see also Section 4.3).

One well-known issue with communication networks is that information can be corrupted as it propagates through the network.24 As AI systems become capable of generating and processing more and more kinds of information, AI agents could end up \u2018polluting the epistemic commons\u2019 (Huang & Siddarth, 2023; Kay et al., 2024) of both other agents (Ju et al., 2024) and humans (see Case Study 7 and Section 3.1) Another increasingly important framework is the use of individual AI agents as part of teams and scaffolded chains of delegation, which transmit not only information but instructions or goals through networks of agents. If these goals are distorted or corrupted, then this can lead to worse outcomes for the delegating agent(s) (Nguyen et al., 2024b; Sourbut et al., 2024). Finally, while the previous examples are phrased in terms of unintentional errors, it may be that certain network structures allow \u2013 or perhaps even encourage \u2013 the spread of errors that are deliberately introduced by malicious agents (Gu et al., 2024; Ju et al., 2024; Lee & Tiwari, 2024, see also Case Study 8).\"",

It is well-understood that models trained on human data \u2013 such as being pre-trained on human-written text or fine-tuned on human feedback \u2013 can exhibit human biases. For these reasons, there has already been considerable attention to measuring biases related to protected characteristics such as sex and ethnicity (e.g., Ferrara, 2023; Liang et al., 2021; Nadeem et al., 2020; Nangia et al., 2020), which can be amplified in multi-agent settings (Acerbi & Stubbersfield, 2023, see also Case Study 7). More recently, there has been increasing attention paid to the measurement of human-like cognitive biases as well (Itzhak et al., 2023; Jones & Steinhardt, 2022; Mazeika et al., 2025; Talboy & Fuller, 2023). Some of these biases and patterns of human thought could reduce the risks of conflict while others could make it worse. For example, the tendencies to mistakenly believe that interactions are zero-sum (sometimes referred to as \u201cfixed-pie error\u201d) and to make self- serving judgements as to what is fair (Caputo, 2013) are known to impede negotiation. Other human tendencies like vengefulness (Jackson et al., 2019) may worsen conflict (L \u0308owenheim & Heimann, 2008).\"",

One of the best-known historical examples to illustrate destabilising dynamics in the context of autonomous agents is the 2010 flash crash, in which algorithmic trading agents entered into an unexpected feedback loop (Commission & Commission, 2010, see also Case Study 10).37 More generally, a feedback loop occurs when the output of a system is used as part of its input, creating a cycle that can either amplify or dampen the system\u2019s behaviour. In multi-agent settings, feedback loops often arise from the interactions between agents, as each agent\u2019s actions affect the environment and the behaviour of other agents, which in turn affect their own subsequent actions. Feedback loops can lead not only to financial crashes but to military conflicts (Richardson, 1960, see also ??) and ecological disasters (Holling, 1973).\"",

Similar non-linear dynamics can emerge in multi- agent learning and lead to a variety of phenomena that do not occur in single-agent learning (Barfuss et al., 2019; Barfuss & Mann, 2022; Galla & Farmer, 2013; Leonardos et al., 2020; Nagarajan et al., 2020). One of the simplest examples of this phenomenon is Q-learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992): in the case of a single agent, convergence to an optimal policy is guaranteed under modest conditions, but in the (mixed-motive) case of multiple agents, this same learning rule can lead to cycles and thus non- convergence (Zinkevich et al., 2005). While cycles in themselves need not carry any risk, their presence can subvert the expected or desirable properties of a given system.\"",

        "description":"\"Phase Transitions. Finally, small external changes to the system \u2013 such as the introduction of new agents or a distributional shift \u2013 can cause phase transitions, where the system undergoes an abrupt qualitative shift in overall behaviour (Barfuss et al., 2024). Formally, this corresponds to bifurcations in the system\u2019s parameter space, which lead to the creation or destruction of dynamical attractors, resulting in complex and unpredictable dynamics (Crawford, 1991; Zeeman, 1976). For example, Leonardos & Piliouras (2022) show that changes to the exploration hyperparameter of RL agents can lead to phase transitions that drastically change the number and stability of the equilibria in a game, which in turn can have potentially unbounded negative effects on agents\u2019 performance. Relatedly, there have been many observations of phase transitions in ML (Carroll, 2021; Olsson et al., 2022; Ziyin & Ueda, 2022), such as \u2018grokking\u2019, in which the test set error decreases rapidly long after the training error has plateaued (Power et al., 2022). These phenomena are still poorly understood, even in the case of a single system.\"",

        "description":"\"Distributional Shift. Individual ML systems can perform poorly in contexts different from those in which they were trained. A key source of these distributional shifts is the actions and adaptations of other agents (Narang et al., 2023; Papoudakis et al., 2019; Piliouras & Yu, 2022), which in single-agent approaches are often simply or ignored or at best modelled exogenously. Indeed, the sheer number and variance of behaviours that can be exhibited other agents means that multi-agent systems pose an especially challenging generalisation problem for individual learners (Agapiou et al., 2022; Leibo et al., 2021; Stone et al., 2010). While distributional shifts can cause issues in common-interest settings (see Section 2.1), they are more worrisome in mixed-motive settings since the ability of agents to cooperate depends not only on the ability to coordinate on one of many arbitrary conventions (which might be easily resolved by a common language), but on their beliefs about what solutions other agents will find acceptable\"",

More generally, an agent could use commitment devices to shift risks or costs to others, allowing it to behave irresponsibly.43 In other cases, it might be the agent that commits to an inflexible (cooperative) course of action which can be exploited by others who can adapt their strategies to this commitment.44 On the other hand, if used carefully, the ability to commit generally strictly empowers the committing agent (Letchford et al., 2013; Stengel & Zamir, 2010).\"",

While this mechanism was intended as a deterrent, its automatic and largely irrevocable nature exemplifies how credible commitments can become dangerously dual-use: once triggered, there would be little chance to override or de-escalate. In a similar vein, during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 an automated US missile defence system shot down a British plane, killing both occupants (Borg et al., 2024; Talbot, 2005). While the system\u2019s operators had one minute to override the system (even in its autonomous mode), they decided to trust its judgment, resulting in a tragic outcome. In more general AI contexts, similarly inflexible commitments could offer short-term advantages or trust but risk uncontrolled escalation, lock-in, and catastrophic outcomes if not carefully designed with appropriate fail-safes and oversight.\"",

Emergent behaviours are distinct from mere accumulations (as in Case Study 12, for example); in other words, the whole may be different to the sum of its parts (Anderson, 1972). While there is a sense in which everything we study in this report can be viewed as \u201cemerging\u201d from multi-agent systems (Altmann et al., 2024; Mogul, 2006), our focus on this section is specifically on the risks associated with emergent agency at the level of the collective.
